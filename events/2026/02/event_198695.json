Intraday trades, highs, lows, bids, offers, midpoint values, or indicative prices do not count.\n\nNote that the settlement price may differ from the last traded price. CME's methodology to determine the settlement price can vary by commodity and contract.\n\nOnly days during February on which CME publishes an official settlement price for the Active Month will be included. Days without settlement prices (weekends, holidays, or market closures) are ignored.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the settlement price as it appears on the CME settlement page at the time it is first published for the relevant trading day, regardless of any later corrections or updates.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the CME Group website — specifically, the daily \"Settlement\" price for the Active Month of Silver (SI) futures.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-28T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-28","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":">$105","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/silver-3d81e98448.png","id":"1335481","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/silver-3d81e98448.png","liquidity":"3177.5284","liquidityClob":3177.5284,"liquidityNum":3177.5284,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xb1fa588b7ace89babe31ae985f51db124cf1940b24765e9f622a379170762c00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xeefe7839254270b43dd64bafd17268f282f501da012353f48372ef4dc2940039","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.13,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.175,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.165\", \"0.835\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Silver (SI) settle at >$105 in February?","questionID":"0xb1fa588b7ace89babe31ae985f51db124cf1940b24765e9f622a379170762c09","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-silver-si-settle-at-105-in-february","spread":0.27,"startDate":"2026-02-04T22:40:34.370756Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-04","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T18:30:37.431873Z"}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xb1fa588b7ace89babe31ae985f51db124cf1940b24765e9f622a379170762c00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/metals/precious/silver.settlements.html","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":26,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T19:58:36.878179Z","icon":"","id":"10806","image":"","liquidity":95515.54331,"recurrence":"monthly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"what-will-silver-si-settle-at","ticker":"what-will-silver-si-settle-at","title":"What will Silver (SI) settle at","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T18:29:17.370433Z","volume":265705.407786,"volume24hr":11684.701415000001}],"seriesSlug":"what-will-silver-si-settle-at","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-silver-si-settle-at-in-february","startDate":"2026-02-04T22:43:21.60885Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2025-05-23T18:47:07.430147Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102169","isCarousel":false,"label":"Hide From New","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"hide-from-new","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:15:10.460422Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-10-22T15:45:27.386784Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101031","label":"Commodities","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"commodities","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:09:32.712099Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-10-04T20:25:11.016117Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100733","isCarousel":false,"label":"Silver","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"silver","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:17:50.72939Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-10-20T23:59:39.96598Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102740","isCarousel":false,"label":"COMEX Silver Futures","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"comex-silver-futures","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:11.132853Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:40.097768Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T22:13:47.21Z","id":"397","label":"futures","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 22:13:47.199+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"futures","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:04:11.781352Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-02-04T20:16:22.98441Z","id":"103639","label":"Silver Futures","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"silver-futures","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:19:40.869614Z"}],"ticker":"what-will-silver-si-settle-at-in-february","title":"What will Silver (SI) settle at in February?","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T18:29:12.029972Z","volume":82.63,"volume1mo":82.63,"volume1wk":82.63,"volume1yr":82.63,"volume24hr":80.13}
