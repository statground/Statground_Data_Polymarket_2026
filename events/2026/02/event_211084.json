A weekly candle is considered finalized once the following week’s candle is published.\n\nThe resolution source is Binance, using the spot USDT trading pairs for each listed asset (e.g. BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT), for example:\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT\n\nIf two or more assets are tied for the highest percentage change, this market will resolve based on whichever comes first alphabetically.\n\nOnly Binance spot USDT-pair data will be used. Prices from other exchanges, trading pairs, or data sources will not be considered.\n\nWeekly candles are defined based on Binance’s chart timezone. For reference, in the ET timezone, the weekly candle for the week of February 16, 2026 is titled “2026/02/15 19:00” on Binance.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-23T04:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-23","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":"Ethena","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/top-performing-crypto-in-february-QrRmwYfog5Gw.jpg","id":"1383659","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/top-performing-crypto-in-february-QrRmwYfog5Gw.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.07,"liquidity":"122.85684","liquidityClob":122.85684,"liquidityNum":122.85684,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x5b05eff7cfd540aa40087fe533d625f137fd37e42b2175592ec9c5af7f5bd100","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xefcff98b0b9a5a66ee30b3be90cd00347da82400c8167b1b869053a16a752462","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.001,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.039\", \"0.961\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Ethena be the top performing crypto for the week of February 16?","questionID":"0x5b05eff7cfd540aa40087fe533d625f137fd37e42b2175592ec9c5af7f5bd109","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-ethena-be-the-top-performing-crypto-for-the-week-of-february-16","spread":0.056,"startDate":"2026-02-16T00:47:31.912458Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-16","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-22T06:35:26.027041Z","volume":"288.244673","volume1mo":288.244673,"volume1moClob":288.244673,"volume1wk":288.244673,"volume1wkClob":288.244673,"volume1yr":288.244673,"volume1yrClob":288.244673,"volume24hr":74.99,"volume24hrClob":74.99,"volumeClob":288.244673,"volumeNum":288.244673}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x5b05eff7cfd540aa40087fe533d625f137fd37e42b2175592ec9c5af7f5bd100","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"top-performing-crypto-for-the-week-of-february-16","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-02-16T00:49:13.076159Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:03:54.564Z","forceShow":false,"id":"21","label":"Crypto","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:03:54.55+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"crypto","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:08:42.483174Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2026-02-16T00:41:40.110759Z","id":"103777","label":"Top Performer","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"top-performer","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T00:45:02.767224Z"}],"ticker":"top-performing-crypto-for-the-week-of-february-16","title":"Top performing crypto for the week of February 16?","updatedAt":"2026-02-22T06:36:03.976Z","volume":2153.119535,"volume1mo":2140.029535,"volume1wk":2140.029535,"volume1yr":2140.029535,"volume24hr":234.76}
