towards the handicap, provided that the match is completed.\n\nIf the match is canceled (not played at all for any reason), ends in a tie, or is delayed beyond 7 days from the scheduled date without a

will resolve to 50-50. \n\nIf the match ends due to the clinching game being forfeited this will count as a completed match.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from
