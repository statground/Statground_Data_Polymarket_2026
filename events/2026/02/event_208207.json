This market will resolve as soon as the relevant data is issued. Any revisions to the data after the first release will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nIf no data for the specified month is released by the date the next month's data is scheduled to be released, this market will resolve based on data from the last available month.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market reports unemployment to one decimal point. Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-04-03T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-04-03","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"6","groupItemTitle":"4.5%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/march-unemployment-rate-wpcB-Q7lTi_r.jpg","id":"1374356","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/march-unemployment-rate-wpcB-Q7lTi_r.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.11,"liquidity":"2733.5622","liquidityClob":2733.5622,"liquidityNum":2733.5622,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xf0126e89c9e7020f6f9b3e3a79ddfb6a2a9bf2f47dc1cf0a7c356b7dafb99800","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x711614cf2c6161d43e4ee61f12267be964d6db0cddce633d10a8549e69f1fe82","new":false,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.16\", \"0.84\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the March 2026 unemployment rate be 4.5%?","questionID":"0xf0126e89c9e7020f6f9b3e3a79ddfb6a2a9bf2f47dc1cf0a7c356b7dafb99806","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-the-march-2026-unemployment-rate-be-4pt5","spread":0.1,"startDate":"2026-02-13T22:02:29.69802Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-13","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T18:39:05.711809Z","volume":"646.161971","volume1mo":646.161971,"volume1moClob":646.161971,"volume1wk":646.161971,"volume1wkClob":646.161971,"volume1yr":646.161971,"volume1yrClob":646.161971,"volume24hr":4,"volume24hrClob":4,"volumeClob":646.161971,"volumeNum":646.161971}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xf0126e89c9e7020f6f9b3e3a79ddfb6a2a9bf2f47dc1cf0a7c356b7dafb99800","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":47,"createdAt":"2025-02-08T18:50:07.180805Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/unemployed1.png","id":"10044","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/unemployed1.png","liquidity":43827.63691,"recurrence":"monthly","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"unemployment","ticker":"unemployment","title":"Unemployment","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T18:39:29.930708Z","volume":8105.942863,"volume24hr":388.91723}],"seriesSlug":"unemployment","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"march-unemployment-rate-561","startDate":"2026-02-13T22:05:30.310798Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:02:41.732549Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:18:12.825123Z","id":"102964","label":"NFP","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"nfp","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:06:52.32241Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:18:12.942636Z","id":"102965","label":"nonfarm payroll","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"nonfarm-payroll","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:20:50.942858Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-09-04T16:26:08.450225Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102548","isCarousel":false,"label":"Jobs Report","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"jobs-report","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:22:01.077376Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:57:53.430333Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102000","label":"Macro Indicators","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"macro-indicators","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:22:01.082663Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-11T22:41:09.272Z","id":"1624","label":"unemployment","publishedAt":"2024-03-11 22:41:09.266+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"unemployment","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:21:20.984928Z"}],"ticker":"march-unemployment-rate","title":"March Unemployment Rate","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T18:39:23.702654Z","volume":6854.232593,"volume1mo":6854.232593,"volume1wk":6854.232593,"volume1yr":6854.232593,"volume24hr":265.06165}
