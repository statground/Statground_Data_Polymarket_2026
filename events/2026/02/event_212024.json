Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the listed term will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g., joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however, \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nThis market is explicitly about the Board of Peace events at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace on February 19, 2026. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of the named, scheduled event will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nAI-generated audio or video will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by February 19, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, \"-No Qualifying Event-\" will resolve to \"Yes\" and all other brackets will resolve to \"No\". \n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events. Only remarks which are broadcast or streamed live will count toward this market's resolution.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-19T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-19","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"17","groupItemTitle":"-No Qualifying Event-","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-trump-say-during-board-of-peace-events-u4KwcsWjd-wQ.jpg","id":"1386576","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-trump-say-during-board-of-peace-events-u4KwcsWjd-wQ.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.001,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.0375,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Trump's remarks at Board of Peace events not air?","questionID":"0x50026b7f8259757daa5c8c934a55355fc70e6d748bac255d5fed94b8c3ded550","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-trumps-remarks-at-board-of-peace-events-not-air","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2026-02-16T20:08:41.085973Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-16","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2026-02-19T16:53:46Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[\"proposed\"]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-21T00:25:21.260707Z","volume":"23746.878665","volume1mo":23746.878665,"volume1moClob":23746.878665,"volume1wk":23746.878665,"volume1wkClob":23746.878665,"volume1yr":23746.878665,"volume1yrClob":23746.878665,"volumeClob":23746.878665,"volumeNum":23746.878665}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-trump-say-during-board-of-peace-events","startDate":"2026-02-16T20:09:22.355035Z","startTime":"2026-02-19T18:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-08-16T02:29:11.548984Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100343","label":"Mentions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mention-markets","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:31.098746Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"what-will-trump-say-during-board-of-peace-events","title":"What will Trump say during Board of Peace events?
