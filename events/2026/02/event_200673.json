(https://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-and-tours/watch-committees-and-debates/prime-ministers-questions/).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Keir Starmer says the listed term during the next Prime Minister's Question Time event he participates in. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nAI-generated audio or video will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nIf no such Prime Minister's Question Time event happens by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\". If Starmer ceases to be Prime Minister for any length of time by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about scheduled events featuring Keir Starmer titled \"Prime Minister's Question Time\" (https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/keir-starmer/dept/cabinet-office/calendar). Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of named, scheduled events will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events.
