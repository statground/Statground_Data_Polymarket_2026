market refers to the Counter-Strike match between Leo Team and KOLESIE in the ESL Challenger League Europe Cup 1 Playoffs, scheduled for February 16 at 1:15PM ET.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Leo Team\" if Leo Team wins 2 or more maps than KOLESIE in this match.\n\nOtherwise, this market will resolve to \"KOLESIE\". \n\nMaps won by forfeit, disqualification, walkover, or default are counted towards the handicap, provided that the match is completed.\n\nIf the match is canceled (not played at all for any reason), ends in a tie, or is delayed beyond 7 days from the scheduled date without a winner determined, this market will resolve to 50-50. \n\nIf the match begins but is not completed, and one team wins due to the opponent's match forfeiture, disqualification, or walkover, this market will resolve to 50-50. \n\nIf the match ends due to the clinching map being forfeited this will count as a completed match.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from https://hltv.org. However, if https://hltv.org has not published final results within 12 hours after the event’s conclusion, a consensus of credible reporting may be used instead including video evidence.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-17T00:15:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-17","eventStartTime":"2026-02-16T18:15:00Z","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"gameStartTime":"2026-02-16 18:15:00+00","groupItemTitle":"Map Handicap: Leo (-1.5) vs KOLESIE (+1.5)","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/counter-strike-image-16c415c538.png","id":"1386532","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/counter-strike-image-16c415c538.png","line":-1.5,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.997,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Leo Team\", \"KOLESIE\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Map Handicap: Leo (-1.5) vs KOLESIE (+1.5)","questionID":"0x339378720cfa8081aea1c8adda55db491e50fcf922fa2ac0374eda06af523af9","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://hltv.org","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":3,"slug":"cs2-leo2-kol-2026-02-16-map-handicap-away-1pt5","sportsMarketType":"map_handicap","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2026-02-16T18:47:40.718545Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-16","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2026-02-16T23:30:59Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[\"proposed\"]","umaReward":"2","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T23:32:20.843851Z","volume":"2440.66","volumeClob":2440.66,"volumeNum":2440.66}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"period":"3/3","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.twitch.tv/majkibets","restricted":true,"score":"000-000|2-1|Bo3","series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":3016,"createdAt":"2025-09-18T23:42:36.322544Z","featured":false,"icon":"","id":"10310","image":"","liquidity":1191865.84321,"recurrence":"daily","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"counter-strike","ticker":"counter-strike","title":"Counter Strike","updatedAt":"2026-02-17T06:45:48.866133Z","volume":984640.198237,"volume24hr":12893169.337969007}],"seriesSlug":"counter-strike","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"cs2-leo2-kol-2026-02-16","startDate":"2026-02-15T15:03:24.69558Z","startTime":"2026-02-16T18:15:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:15:31.93Z","forceShow":false,"id":"64","label":"Esports","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:15:31.924+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"esports","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:04:11.814654Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-10-09T18:28:05.24087Z","id":"100780","label":"counter strike 2","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"counter-strike-2","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:04:11.806034Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-09-23T22:41:37.670714Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100639","label":"Games","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"games","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:08:42.474229Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-24T22:37:50.31Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"1","label":"Sports","publishedAt":"2023-10-24 22:37:50.296+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"sports","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:05:01.908169Z","updatedBy":15}],"ticker":"cs2-leo2-kol-2026-02-16","title":"Counter-Strike: Leo Team vs KOLESIE (BO3) - ESL Challenger League Europe Cup 1 Playoffs","updatedAt":"2026-02-17T06:45:46.393833Z","volume":13152.832218,"volume1mo":7021.473491,"volume1wk":7021.473491,"volume1yr":7021.473491,"volume24hr":7021.473491}
