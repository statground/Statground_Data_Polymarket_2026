If additional seats are contested after the results of this election are made official (i.e., seats reserved for women are contested at a later date), those seats will not be considered for resolution of this market. If a second house of the Bangladeshi parliament is established, seats in that house will not be considered for resolution of this market.\n\nSeats uncontested during the February 12 election (e.g., Sherpur-3) will not be considered for resolution of this market.\n\nIf the results of this election are not known by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to the lowest range bracket.\n\nThis market's resolution will be based solely on the number of seats won by the specified party, not any coalition or alliance of which it may be a part.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the election results as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results as reported by the Bangladeshi Government, specifically the Bangladesh Election Commission (https://www.ecs.gov.bd/?lang=en).","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-12T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-12","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"250+","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-bangladesh-nationalist-party-win-the-most-seats-in-the-bangladesh-house-of-the-nation-election-kRBi1ql1R0yq.png","id":"1353122","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-bangladesh-nationalist-party-win-the-most-seats-in-the-bangladesh-house-of-the-nation-election-kRBi1ql1R0yq.png","liquidity":"54.3191","liquidityClob":54.3191,"liquidityNum":54.3191,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x6579b75705d842c0bbb3f45672577ac879f53957114c91296810552a34465900","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x0472862681a735244bc9ac93e51f8330a39554c5736b18f04caa678c2341810c","new":false,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.465\", \"0.535\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) win 250 or more seats in the Bangladesh parliamentary election?","questionID":"0x6579b75705d842c0bbb3f45672577ac879f53957114c91296810552a34465904","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-the-bangladesh-nationalist-party-bnp-win-250-or-more-seats-in-the-bangladesh-parliamentary-election","spread":0.85,"startDate":"2026-02-10T00:18:16.705892Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-10","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T01:23:26.167309Z"}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x6579b75705d842c0bbb3f45672577ac879f53957114c91296810552a34465900","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"of-bnp-seats-after-the-2026-bangladesh-parliamentary-election","startDate":"2026-02-10T00:20:06.38629Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:24:31.198Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"144","label":"Elections","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:24:31.008+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"elections","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:14:30.314987Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T17:08:04.675667Z","forceShow":false,"id":"103278","isCarousel":false,"label":"Bangladesh Election","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"bangladesh-election","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:02.879539Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2024-03-07T20:41:56.773Z","createdBy":15,"forceShow":true,"id":"1597","label":"Global Elections","publishedAt":"2024-03-07 20:44:01.258+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"global-elections","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:31.077819Z","updatedBy":15}],"ticker":"of-bnp-seats-after-the-2026-bangladesh-parliamentary-election","title":"# of BNP seats after the 2026 Bangladesh Parliamentary Election?","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T01:24:00.762618Z"}
