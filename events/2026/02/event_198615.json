The release must be clearly defined and publicly announced by Google as being accessible to the general public.\n\nGemini 3.5 refers to a product explicitly named Gemini 3.5 (e.g., Gemini 3.5 Pro would count), or one that is recognized as a successor to Gemini 3, similar to the progression from Gemini 2.0 to Gemini 2.5. Products labeled as Gemini 4 or similar will not count for this market's resolution. Additional Gemini 3 models (e.g. a release of Gemini 3 Flash-lite) will not count.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from Google, with additional verification from a consensus of credible reporting.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-06-30T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-06-30","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"2","groupItemTitle":"May 31","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gemini-3pt0-released-by-Jgab86ADS9yM.png","id":"1360928","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gemini-3pt0-released-by-Jgab86ADS9yM.png","lastTradePrice":0.44,"liquidity":"5550.4896","liquidityClob":5550.4896,"liquidityNum":5550.4896,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.39,"oneHourPriceChange":-0.05,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.21,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.375\", \"0.625\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Gemini 3.5 released by May 31?","questionID":"0x40bfa82cec77aabcaa4f45e813518fabce35c03b6db42cf68b74c86630d33dbc","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"gemini-3pt5-released-by-may-31","spread":0.01,"startDate":"2026-02-09T19:40:19.298344Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-09","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-20T01:14:50.007545Z","volume":"20058.570736","volume1mo":19466.110735999995,"volume1moClob":19466.110735999995,"volume1wk":17738.110736000002,"volume1wkClob":17738.110736000002,"volume1yr":19466.110735999995,"volume1yrClob":19466.110735999995,"volume24hr":5780.137810000001,"volume24hrClob":5780.137810000001,"volumeClob":20058.570736,"volumeNum":20058.570736}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"gemini-3pt5-released-by-june-30","startDate":"2026-02-04T20:28:01.322148Z","startTime":"2026-02-19T17:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T23:06:12.324Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1401","label":"Tech","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 23:06:12.305+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:17:30.722289Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T23:08:32.49Z","forceShow":true,"id":"439","isCarousel":true,"label":"AI","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 23:08:32.469+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ai","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:51.126491Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2023-12-06T23:16:31.435Z","id":"663","label":"google","publishedAt":"2023-12-06 23:16:31.424+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"google","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:31.111122Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:20:37.488Z","forceShow":false,"id":"107","label":"Business","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:20:37.48+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"business","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.874409Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:46:09.386953Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101999","label":"Big Tech","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"big-tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:51.153305Z"}],"ticker":"gemini-3pt5-released-by-june-30","title":"Gemini 3.5 released by...?","updatedAt":"2026-02-20T01:12:09.921112Z","volume":478831.855288,"volume1mo":475263.697352,"volume1wk":385658.94993199984,"volume1yr":475263.697352,"volume24hr":148813.28424900008}
