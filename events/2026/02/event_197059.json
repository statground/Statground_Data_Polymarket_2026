Daily data will be considered finalized once the following day’s data point is published.\n\nThis market will resolve as soon as the price shown on the Silicon Data H100 chart is equal to or below the listed price, or once the value for February 28, 2026 is finalized. If no data for February 28, 2026 has been finalized by March 14, 2026, this market will resolve based on the data available at that time.\n\nRevisions made to previously published data points on the H100 Index chart, before the February 28, 2026 data point has been finalized, will be considered; however, they will not disqualify a previously published data point from resolving this market. Revisions made after the February 28, 2026, data point has been finalized will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-28T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-28","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"11","groupItemTitle":"↓ $1.80","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-gpu-rental-prices-h100-hit-by-april-30-uGSYBY0KHFa-.jpg","id":"1323000","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-gpu-rental-prices-h100-hit-by-april-30-uGSYBY0KHFa-.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.015,"liquidity":"3900.07576","liquidityClob":3900.07576,"liquidityNum":3900.07576,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.0085,"oneHourPriceChange":-0.0005,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.014\", \"0.986\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the Silicon Data H100 Index (SDH100RT) hit $1.80 (LOW) by February 28, 2026?","questionID":"0x528dec4ceb6a7f942e1356a11963d891009df50ce973d89f6ee7fd7aa4acf7a5","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-the-silicon-data-h100-index-sdh100rt-hit-1pt80-low-by-february-28-2026","spread":0.008,"startDate":"2026-02-03T15:33:32.846603Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-03","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T18:35:23.231171Z","volume":"2268.898865","volume1mo":2157.358865,"volume1moClob":2157.358865,"volume1wk":2157.358865,"volume1wkClob":2157.358865,"volume1yr":2157.358865,"volume1yrClob":2157.358865,"volume24hr":784.94055,"volume24hrClob":784.94055,"volumeClob":2268.898865,"volumeNum":2268.898865}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":9,"createdAt":"2026-02-04T21:03:03.192701Z","icon":"","id":"11112","image":"","liquidity":45377.74621,"recurrence":"annual","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"gpu-rental-prices","ticker":"gpu-rental-prices","title":"GPU Rental Prices","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T18:33:31.878978Z","volume":241630.641385,"volume24hr":87894.072086}],"seriesSlug":"gpu-rental-prices","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-gpu-rental-prices-h100-hit-in-february","startDate":"2026-02-03T15:34:19.555619Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-02-14T22:19:45.518Z","id":"1330","label":"nvidia","publishedAt":"2024-02-14 22:19:45.496+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"nvidia","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:28:55.280499Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:37:56.077596Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T23:06:12.324Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1401","label":"Tech","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 23:06:12.305+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tech","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:03:00.008799Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:20:37.488Z","forceShow":false,"id":"107","label":"Business","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:20:37.48+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"business","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:03:10.539227Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-02-02T23:44:55.262619Z","id":"103392","label":"Chip","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"chip","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T23:45:00.70555Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T23:08:32.49Z","forceShow":true,"id":"439","isCarousel":true,"label":"AI","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 23:08:32.469+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ai","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:32:35.456496Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2026-02-02T23:28:25.782148Z","id":"103391","label":"SDH100RT","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"sdh100rt","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T23:30:00.721529Z"}],"ticker":"what-will-gpu-rental-prices-h100-hit-in-february","title":"GPU rental prices (H100) hit___ in February?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T18:35:45.984055Z","volume":158342.009833,"volume1mo":157777.689833,"volume1wk":157777.689833,"volume1yr":157777.689833,"volume24hr":64454.642541}
