Seats uncontested during the June 3 election will not have any impact on the resolution of this market.\n\nIf the results of these elections are not known by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Other”.\nThis market’s resolution will be based solely on the number of seats won by the specified parties in these elections, not any coalition or alliance of which they may be a part.\n\nIn the event of a tie between multiple parties for the most seats won, this market will resolve in favor of the party that received a greater number of valid votes across all the relevant parliamentary by-elections. In the event that results in a tie, this market will resolve in favor of the party whose listed full name appears first in alphabetical order.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the results of the elections as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results as reported by the South Korean government, specifically the National Election Commission.\n\nNote: this market includes any National Assembly seats contested in by-elections scheduled for June 3, 2026, not just elections which are scheduled as of this market’s creation.","enableOrderBook":true,"featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":"Party D","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/south-korea-by-elections-party-winner-M_CFcSmvDdQj.png","id":"1364476","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/south-korea-by-elections-party-winner-M_CFcSmvDdQj.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":true,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xe22e18bf41b90f844a7683dde1d610b8ce2d67f9b951508429b0b96c860ece00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x50fdce6ce7136431d2c9d1d888f3869cf75dc448ed0194cd8c0014ec9fbbb7b0","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Party D win the most seats in South Korea’s 2026 parliamentary by-elections?","questionID":"0xe22e18bf41b90f844a7683dde1d610b8ce2d67f9b951508429b0b96c860ece09","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-party-d-win-the-most-seats-in-south-koreas-2026-parliamentary-by-elections","spread":1,"startDate":"2026-02-12T21:20:51.047055Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-13T16:33:27.310525Z","volume":"0","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume24hrAmm":0,"volume24hrClob":0,"volumeAmm":0,"volumeClob":0,"volumeNum":0}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xe22e18bf41b90f844a7683dde1d610b8ce2d67f9b951508429b0b96c860ece00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"south-korea-by-elections-party-winner","startDate":"2026-02-12T21:23:31.486917Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2026-02-10T23:28:41.971358Z","id":"103726","label":"Democratic Party of Korea","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"democratic-party-of-korea","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T23:30:02.685279Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:24:31.198Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"144","label":"Elections","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:24:31.008+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"elections","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:14:30.314987Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:29:08.413Z","forceShow":false,"id":"166","label":"South Korea","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:29:08.405+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"south-korea","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.877706Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-07T20:41:56.773Z","createdBy":15,"forceShow":true,"id":"1597","label":"Global Elections","publishedAt":"2024-03-07 20:44:01.258+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"global-elections","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:31.077819Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2026-02-11T00:19:17.907488Z","id":"103729","label":"People's Power Party","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"peoples-power-party","updatedAt":"2026-02-11T00:20:02.879072Z"}],"ticker":"south-korea-by-elections-party-winner","title":"South Korea By-Elections: Party Winner","updatedAt":"2026-02-20T01:12:09.860033Z","volume":38923.932843,"volume1mo":38923.932843,"volume1wk":38923.932843,"volume1yr":38923.932843,"volume24hr":10.1}
