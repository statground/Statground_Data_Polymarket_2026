The Street consensus estimate for AMC Entertainment’s non-GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $-0.25 as of market creation. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if AMC Entertainment reports non-GAAP EPS greater than $-0.25 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents. \n\nIf AMC Entertainment releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents; or, if not published there, according to the GAAP EPS provided by SeekingAlpha.
