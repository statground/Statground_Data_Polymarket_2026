If the insurrection case is formally consolidated with other cases into a single judgment, this market will resolve based on the total sentence issued for this consolidated case.\n\nThis market will resolve immediately based on the first sentence rendered in this case, regardless of any appeals. If Yoon Suk Yeol is found not guilty, there is a mistrial, or if the first sentencing does not include any jail or prison time, this market will resolve to \"No Prison Time.\" If Yoon Suk Yeol is sentenced to life in prison, this market will resolve to the highest bracket.\n\nFor the purposes of this market, it does not matter whether the sentence is concurrent or consecutive to any existing sentence Yoon Suk Yeol is already serving. The market will resolve based on the total prison sentence imposed in this case.\n\nIf no sentencing takes place by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will also resolve to \"No Prison Time.\"\n\nIf the sentence falls exactly between two brackets, then this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the South Korean government and court system; however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-12-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-12-31","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"60+ Years","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/yoon-insurrection-case-prison-sentence-GFSQQvTiMdM1.jpg","id":"1373451","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/yoon-insurrection-case-prison-sentence-GFSQQvTiMdM1.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.9,"liquidity":"6319.9937","liquidityClob":6319.9937,"liquidityNum":6319.9937,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xf88049124f2ba82ba0afc0a573905806e43b035d64abc1414fc593506b38c200","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xdf82e4a2be4c373a7db61b362789d3e1422310793fe7daa1a50d2919ba4965cb","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.01,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.885\", \"0.115\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Yoon Suk Yeol be sentenced to at least 60 years in prison?","questionID":"0xf88049124f2ba82ba0afc0a573905806e43b035d64abc1414fc593506b38c203","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-yoon-suk-yeol-be-sentenced-to-at-least-60-years-in-prison","spread":0.01,"startDate":"2026-02-13T21:38:09.353913Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-13","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T12:37:09.361493Z","volume":"27494.86642","volume1mo":26678.78218,"volume1moClob":26678.78218,"volume1wk":26678.78218,"volume1wkClob":26678.78218,"volume1yr":26678.78218,"volume1yrClob":26678.78218,"volume24hr":16176.911388000002,"volume24hrClob":16176.911388000002,"volumeClob":27494.86642,"volumeNum":27494.86642}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xf88049124f2ba82ba0afc0a573905806e43b035d64abc1414fc593506b38c200","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"yoon-suk-yeol-insurrection-case-prison-time-wider-strikes","startDate":"2026-02-13T21:40:10.134847Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:10:12.806715Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:29:08.413Z","forceShow":false,"id":"166","label":"South Korea","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:29:08.405+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"south-korea","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.877706Z"}],"ticker":"yoon-suk-yeol-insurrection-case-prison-time-wider-strikes","title":"Yoon Suk Yeol Insurrection Case Prison Time?
