This market will resolve to “No” if, for any reason, the results of the respective vote are not known definitively by June 30, 2026, 11:59 PM ET.\n\nThe resolution source will be based on a consensus of credible reporting. In the event of ambiguity, this market will resolve solely based on the official certified referendum results published by Swiss government authorities, such as the Swiss Federal Chancellery (https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20260308.html). Subsequent litigation, administrative challenges, or failure of any post-approval implementation steps will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-08T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-03-08","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"Individual taxation","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/switzerlands-march-8-popular-vote-which-referendums-will-pass-kjuMz9X_LLrP.png","id":"1360205","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/switzerlands-march-8-popular-vote-which-referendums-will-pass-kjuMz9X_LLrP.png","lastTradePrice":0.977,"liquidity":"22665.09355","liquidityClob":22665.09355,"liquidityNum":22665.09355,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.0035,"oneHourPriceChange":0.0005,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.977\", \"0.023\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the Individual taxation referendum be approved in Switzerland’s 8 March 2026 popular vote?","questionID":"0xc198b6d775affda1c5d867e472e69f6dffb9617be57e28936144f7040d033293","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-the-individual-taxation-referendum-be-approved-in-switzerlands-8-march-2026-popular-vote","spread":0.002,"startDate":"2026-02-12T22:18:02.824655Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-12","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T01:17:09.751719Z","volume":"7250.49971","volume1mo":7250.499710000001,"volume1moClob":7250.499710000001,"volume1wk":7250.499710000001,"volume1wkClob":7250.499710000001,"volume1yr":7250.499710000001,"volume1yrClob":7250.499710000001,"volume24hr":340.98880599999995,"volume24hrClob":340.98880599999995,"volumeClob":7250.49971,"volumeNum":7250.49971}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"switzerlands-march-referendum-what-will-pass","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-02-12T22:20:12.807636Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-06T15:40:43.131Z","id":"456","label":"referendum","publishedAt":"2023-11-06 15:40:43.097+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"referendum","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:22:50.962259Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-06T19:58:33.57Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1199","label":"Popular Vote","publishedAt":"2024-02-06 19:58:33.565+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"popular-vote","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:09:02.549091Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T00:23:43.628Z","id":"1379","label":"switzerland","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 00:23:43.561+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"switzerland","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:18:10.738092Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2025-03-19T23:36:08.498099Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101970","label":"World","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"world","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:04:41.800728Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-02-09T16:56:08.918011Z","id":"103697","label":"Referenda","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"referenda","updatedAt":"2026-02-09T17:00:01.351293Z"}],"ticker":"switzerlands-march-referendum-what-will-pass","title":"Switzerland’s March Referendum: What will pass?","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T01:15:39.30035Z","volume":16595.967179,"volume1mo":16595.967179,"volume1wk":16595.967179,"volume1yr":16595.967179,"volume24hr":2269.934382}
