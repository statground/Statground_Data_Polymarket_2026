Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release, which reports inflation over 12-month periods to only one decimal point (e.g., 2.9%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.\n\nIf the BLS does not release the relevant figures on the scheduled date, this market may remain open up until the scheduled release time of the next CPI report (https://www.bls.gov/schedule). If the information is not released by that time, this market will resolve according to the figures of the most recent previous month with available data.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-04-10T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-04-10","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"6","groupItemTitle":"2.6%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/january-inflation-annual-vp5qkgK2R7Et.jpg","id":"1374261","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/january-inflation-annual-vp5qkgK2R7Et.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.06,"liquidity":"3668.6974","liquidityClob":3668.6974,"liquidityNum":3668.6974,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xb31f29ca2bab193029542ab810afcb07f82e596e60c55ad445109153fa728900","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x2e1cd832b40e82633217c25e37a8424398f6f52bcb6ee599d668dd39b3a5f236","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.08,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.055\", \"0.945\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will annual inflation increase by 2.6% in March?","questionID":"0xb31f29ca2bab193029542ab810afcb07f82e596e60c55ad445109153fa728906","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-annual-inflation-increase-by-2pt6-in-march-845","spread":0.05,"startDate":"2026-02-13T22:01:22.642553Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-13","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-17T06:44:38.725886Z","volume":"498.017825","volume1mo":498.017825,"volume1moClob":498.017825,"volume1wk":498.017825,"volume1wkClob":498.017825,"volume1yr":498.017825,"volume1yrClob":498.017825,"volumeClob":498.017825,"volumeNum":498.017825}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xb31f29ca2bab193029542ab810afcb07f82e596e60c55ad445109153fa728900","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":167,"createdAt":"2025-01-21T17:06:35.709814Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/january-inflation-annual-vp5qkgK2R7Et.jpg","id":"10007","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/january-inflation-annual-vp5qkgK2R7Et.jpg","liquidity":82898.36673,"recurrence":"monthly","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"us-annual-inflation","ticker":"us-annual-inflation","title":"US Annual Inflation ","updatedAt":"2026-02-17T06:45:51.603031Z","volume":6673.520929,"volume24hr":1029.110569}],"seriesSlug":"us-annual-inflation","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"march-inflation-us-annual","startDate":"2026-02-13T22:02:19.288992Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-12-11T19:05:53.105Z","forceShow":false,"id":"702","label":"Inflation","publishedAt":"2023-12-11 19:05:53.075+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"inflation","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:11.011632Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:02:41.732549Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:57:53.430333Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102000","label":"Macro Indicators","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"macro-indicators","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:22:01.082663Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-01-15T17:47:57.759787Z","id":"101701","label":"cpi","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"cpi","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.834819Z"}],"ticker":"march-inflation-us-annual","title":"March Inflation US - Annual","updatedAt":"2026-02-17T06:45:44.642987Z","volume":4517.14687,"volume1mo":4481.581157,"volume1wk":4481.581157,"volume1yr":4481.581157,"volume24hr":123.35}
