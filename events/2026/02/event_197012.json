3-day opening weekend (February 6 - February 8) are final (i.e., not studio estimates).\n\nIf the reported value falls exactly between two brackets, then this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.\n\nPlease note, this market will resolve according to the The Numbers figures provided under Weekend Box Office Performance for the 3-day weekend (which typically includes Thursday's previews), regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is ambiguity as to whether the resolution source's figures are final, this market will remain open until both https://www.boxofficemojo.com/ and https://www.the-numbers.com/ have confirmed their finalized figures.\n\nIf there is no final data available by February 15, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-09T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-09","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":">8.5m","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/solo-mio-opening-weekend-box-office-2nq7UCdYja_Y.jpg","id":"1322615","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/solo-mio-opening-weekend-box-office-2nq7UCdYja_Y.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.002,"liquidity":"6373.62899","liquidityClob":6373.62899,"liquidityNum":6373.62899,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xd0096ed95fd09d085f73549d46bee3932dfec6cd38b018d84e8995b275ee5100","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xe973d1de9d769948d984ed8c4d620c9cfc504f96dcf6b454fd3d90a05598946c","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.034,"oneHourPriceChange":-0.0015,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0005\",
