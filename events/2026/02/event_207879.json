Business day refers to any day treated as such by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nAny revisions to the daily SOFR values published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to the release of SOFR data for the final business day on or before February 28, 2026 will be considered; however, these revisions will not disqualify a previously published SOFR rate from counting. Any revisions published after the release of SOFR data for the final business day on or before February 28, 2026 will not be considered.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, specifically the Secured Overnight Financing Rate Data table at https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/sofr.\n\nNote: This market’s resolution source publishes the SOFR rate to two decimal places (e.g. 3.65%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving this market.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-02T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-03-02","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"7","groupItemTitle":"↓3.59%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-sofr-hit-in-february-lQUTul1hllrN.png","id":"1373327","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-sofr-hit-in-february-lQUTul1hllrN.png","liquidity":"142.88955","liquidityClob":142.88955,"liquidityNum":142.88955,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.465,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.025\", \"0.975\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will SOFR hit 3.59% (Low) between February 13 and February 28?","questionID":"0x92f2f8605bdd15661688f03072e7e09352b4250273ae9dc1321e712df88f59a3","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-sofr-hit-3pt59-low-between-february-13-and-february-28","spread":0.03,"startDate":"2026-02-18T00:05:18.166438Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-18","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-21T01:06:43.819959Z","volume":"130.88","volume1mo":130.88,"volume1moClob":130.88,"volume1wk":130.88,"volume1wkClob":130.88,"volume1yr":130.88,"volume1yrClob":130.88,"volume24hr":130.88,"volume24hrClob":130.88,"volumeClob":130.88,"volumeNum":130.88}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"will-sofr-hit-in-february","startDate":"2026-02-18T00:07:59.630754Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:40.097768Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:31.816Z","forceHide":false,"forceShow":false,"id":"131","label":"interest rates","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:31.802+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"interest-rates","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:07:32.317422Z","updatedBy":15},{"forceShow":true,"id":"100196","label":"Fed Rates","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"fed-rates","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:03:31.746145Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T14:24:57.053668Z","id":"103274","label":"Rate","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"rate","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:19.867238Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:57:53.430333Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102000","label":"Macro Indicators","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"macro-indicators","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:22:01.082663Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-02-13T16:22:09.34564Z","id":"103765","label":"LIBOR","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"libor","updatedAt":"2026-02-13T16:25:03.930676Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-02-13T16:22:09.424808Z","id":"103766","label":"Secured Overnight Financing Rate","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"secured-overnight-financing-rate","updatedAt":"2026-02-13T16:25:03.928646Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-02-13T16:22:09.332718Z","id":"103764","label":"Overnight","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"overnight","updatedAt":"2026-02-13T16:25:03.932879Z"}],"ticker":"will-sofr-hit-in-february","title":"Will SOFR hit __ in February?","updatedAt":"2026-02-21T01:06:59.453384Z","volume":14215.397148,"volume1mo":3057.633332,"volume1wk":3057.633332,"volume1yr":3057.633332,"volume24hr":304.88}
