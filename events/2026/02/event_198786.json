Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nClassifications of an incident while it is ongoing will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. Only classifications of events that are resolved will be considered.\n\nQualifying incidents include outages and other issues classified as critical when they are resolved, during this market's above specified timeframe. \n\nAn incident resolved outside this market’s timeframe will only qualify if ongoing at this market’s resolution time, in which case the market will remain open until that incident is marked as “Resolved,” and resolution will be based on the first impact classification thereafter, regardless of subsequent revisions or corrections.\n\nRevisions that upgrade an incident’s impact classification to Critical will qualify if the incident was resolved and the revision is published within this market’s timeframe.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from Cloudflare (for example, on cloudflarestatus.com or cloudflarestatus.com/history); however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-03-31","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"June 30","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/another-cloudflare-outage-by-december-31-ZvgP8wCUPojG.png","id":"1342509","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/another-cloudflare-outage-by-december-31-ZvgP8wCUPojG.png","lastTradePrice":0.82,"liquidity":"3859.1641","liquidityClob":3859.1641,"liquidityNum":3859.1641,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.015,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.035,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.8\", \"0.2\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Another critical Cloudflare incident by June 30, 2026?","questionID":"0x77e368c3b299da4835852fb471078f1216deb48a4dbbfae89a9f22cd4d054abb","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"another-critical-cloudflare-incident-by-june-30-2026","spread":0.06,"startDate":"2026-02-05T21:08:51.031951Z","startDateIso":"2026-02-05","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-14T01:13:36.031051Z","volume":"8440.875331","volume1mo":8440.875331000001,"volume1moClob":8440.875331000001,"volume1wk":6352.433015000001,"volume1wkClob":6352.433015000001,"volume1yr":8440.875331000001,"volume1yrClob":8440.875331000001,"volume24hr":947.439022,"volume24hrClob":947.439022,"volumeClob":8440.875331,"volumeNum":8440.875331}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"another-critical-cloudflare-incident-by-528","startDate":"2026-02-05T21:09:14.743218Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:10:12.806715Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2025-12-05T19:39:43.316224Z","id":"102940","label":"Industry","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"industry","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:20:30.925188Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T23:06:12.324Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1401","label":"Tech","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 23:06:12.305+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:17:30.722289Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:20:37.488Z","forceShow":false,"id":"107","label":"Business","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:20:37.48+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"business","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.874409Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-02-21T15:53:59.719006Z","id":"101890","label":"hack","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"hack","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:42.988594Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:46:09.386953Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101999","label":"Big Tech","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"big-tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:51.153305Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-05T16:50:44.058Z","id":"1563","label":"outage","publishedAt":"2024-03-05 16:50:43.894+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"outage","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:02:00.322493Z"}],"ticker":"another-critical-cloudflare-incident-by-528","title":"Another critical Cloudflare incident by...?","updatedAt":"2026-02-14T01:14:05.782924Z","volume":60571.535735,"volume1mo":60571.535735000005,"volume1wk":39687.064728000005,"volume1yr":60571.535735000005,"volume24hr":9845.023307}
