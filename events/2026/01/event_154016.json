If any justices issue a dissent or note non-participation, they will not count.\n\nIf an emergency order in favor of the petitioner is the final disposition of the case, all participating justices will be counted excluding dissents and noted non-participation. If an emergency order against the petitioner is the final disposition of the case, all dissenters who would have granted relief to the petitioner will count.\n\nIf the case is dismissed as improvidently granted, dismissed for mootness, vacated and remanded without decision, withdrawn or settled, otherwise concluded without a final merits judgment, or there has been no qualifying ruling for this case by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to the lowest option, regardless of whether any justices issue separate opinions outside of a final judgment which express support for the petitioner.\n\nJustices who are recused or who do not participate will not count. \n\nOnly the final votes recorded in the Supreme Court’s official slip opinion, summary disposition, or order will count. Leaked drafts, opinions, or other information will not count.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the United States Supreme Court; however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":"9","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-scotus-justices-rule-in-favor-of-trumps-tarriffs-ysSaG6GurCGW.jpg","id":"1146052","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-scotus-justices-rule-in-favor-of-trumps-tarriffs-ysSaG6GurCGW.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.002,"liquidity":"3342.70048","liquidityClob":3342.70048,"liquidityNum":3342.70048,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xb7baa7c95d0874e3e0bc79b5155e08502eca0117ace067f773e667ff4c13cd00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x94cb6392b0bce297bc2a1342ad21bbbdfef83245120fb15d20d384d624e2ef65","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.001,"oneMonthPriceChange":-0.0005,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.0005,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0025\", \"0.9975\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will 9 judges rule in favor of Trump's Tarriffs?","questionID":"0xb7baa7c95d0874e3e0bc79b5155e08502eca0117ace067f773e667ff4c13cd09","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-9-judges-rule-in-favor-of-trumps-tarriffs","spread":0.003,"startDate":"2026-01-09T22:03:22.68896Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-09","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-11T06:50:46.218279Z","volume":"8260.014407","volume1mo":7662.161606999998,"volume1moClob":7662.161606999998,"volume1wk":1475.713,"volume1wkClob":1475.713,"volume1yr":8260.014406999999,"volume1yrClob":8260.014406999999,"volume24hr":402.744,"volume24hrClob":402.744,"volumeClob":8260.014407,"volumeNum":8260.014407}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xb7baa7c95d0874e3e0bc79b5155e08502eca0117ace067f773e667ff4c13cd00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-many-scotus-justices-rule-in-favor-of-trumps-tarriffs","startDate":"2026-01-09T22:05:31.823014Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:05:42.017208Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-03-12T00:56:52.397Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1628","label":"Courts","publishedAt":"2024-03-12 00:56:52.382+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"courts","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:22:01.000566Z"},{"id":"100188","label":"Supreme Court ","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"supreme-court","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:10:12.808481Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:37:46.862815Z","id":"103104","label":"tarriffs","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tarriffs","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:08:22.409966Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:21.058056Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2025-02-02T19:17:11.9689Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101761","label":"Trade War","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trade-war","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:06:52.305831Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-02-02T18:39:54.837002Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101758","label":"Tariffs","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tariffs","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:02:41.720126Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-scotus-justices-rule-in-favor-of-trumps-tarriffs","title":"How many SCOTUS justices rule in favor of Trump's tariffs?","updatedAt":"2026-02-11T06:51:26.59138Z","volume":141085.617365,"volume1mo":116324.12257499999,"volume1wk":19389.143238,"volume1yr":140462.571487,"volume24hr":4032.188532}
