Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nAI-generated audio or video will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nIf no such Prime Minister's Question Time event happens by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\". If Starmer ceases to be Prime Minister for any length of time by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about scheduled events featuring Keir Starmer titled \"Prime Minister's Question Time\" (https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/keir-starmer/dept/cabinet-office/calendar).
