Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf prerecorded clips are aired where people are speaking, those clips will count toward this market's resolution.\n\nAI-generated audio or video will count toward this market's resolution.\n\nAny usage of the term, regardless of context, will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market; however, other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nAny qualifying mention must be audibly, intelligibly and fully stated. Any term which cannot be heard in its entirety will not qualify.\n\nOnly the official Netflix broadcast of the event will count towards the resolution of this market.\n\nIf no such stream is aired by January 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video and audio of the event.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-23T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-23","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"Die 5+ times","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-be-said-during-alex-honnolds-taipei-101-climb-VGeKAxd9XDAz.jpg","id":"1242139","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-be-said-during-alex-honnolds-taipei-101-climb-VGeKAxd9XDAz.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.37,"liquidity":"538.5727","liquidityClob":538.5727,"liquidityNum":538.5727,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.035,"oneHourPriceChange":0.02,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.35\", \"0.65\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will \"Die\" be said 5+ times during the Taipei 101 climb?","questionID":"0xfca68b584c111cd31b405b5f7a035c8bba709faa06483bbd818097d813ee2d1f","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-die-be-said-5-times-during-the-taipei-101-climb-587","spread":0.08,"startDate":"2026-01-22T15:26:34.949091Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-22","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T18:17:23.144326Z","volume":"1027.484847","volume1mo":968.746111,"volume1moClob":968.746111,"volume1wk":968.746111,"volume1wkClob":968.746111,"volume1yr":968.746111,"volume1yrClob":968.746111,"volume24hr":817.7317800000001,"volume24hrClob":817.7317800000001,"volumeClob":1027.484847,"volumeNum":1027.484847}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"what-will-be-said-during-alex-honnolds-taipei-101-climb","startDate":"2026-01-22T15:27:03.503613Z","startTime":"2026-01-24T01:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-29T18:40:14.63Z","forceShow":false,"id":"596","label":"Culture","publishedAt":"2023-11-29 18:40:13.013+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"pop-culture","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:12:35.591029Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-30T22:49:48.666337Z","id":"100407","label":"netflix","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"netflix","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:12:39.676601Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-16T02:29:11.548984Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100343","label":"Mentions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mention-markets","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:12:39.582419Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-22T16:41:35.523918Z","forceShow":false,"id":"103224","isCarousel":false,"label":"Skyscraper Climb","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"skyscraper-climb","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T16:45:03.604413Z"}],"ticker":"what-will-be-said-during-alex-honnolds-taipei-101-climb","title":"What will be said during Alex Honnold's Taipei 101 climb?","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T18:17:39.298942Z","volume":6209.154363,"volume1mo":6069.215627,"volume1wk":6069.215627,"volume1yr":6069.215627,"volume24hr":5011.089051}
