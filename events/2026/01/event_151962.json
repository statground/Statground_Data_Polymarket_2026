The Street consensus estimate for McCormick & Company’s non-GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $0.88 as of market creation.

Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents. \n\nIf McCormick & Company releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha.
