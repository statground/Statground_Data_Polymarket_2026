market will resolve according to the Magnificent 7 company which has the best stock performance during the week beginning January 26, 2026, measured as the percentage change in price during the specified week for each company’s stock.\n\nIf a Magnificent 7 company has multiple publicly-tradable stock classes or other equity assets, the stock price used for resolution of this market will be the stock class or share type corresponding to the ticker listed in this market group.\n\nThe percentage change in price for each stock will be calculated by comparing the official NASDAQ closing price of the relevant stock for the last trading day of the specified week to the official NASDAQ closing price for the relevant stock for the last trading day of the previous week.\n\nE.g., ordinarily, a weekly market would refer to the previous Friday for the closing price of the last trading day of the previous week, unless that Friday were a market holiday, in which case it would refer to Thursday, or the next most recent trading day.\n\nIf any Magnificent 7 company’s stock does not trade at all during the relevant regular session, the closing price for the previous regular session in which the stock traded will be used for resolution.\n\nIf either of the relevant days have no official closing price (for example, due to a trading halt into the market close, system issue, delisting, or other disruption), this market will use the last valid on-exchange trade price of the regular session as the effective closing price.\n\nIf two or more Magnificent 7 companies are exactly tied for the best stock performance during the specified week, resolution will be based on whichever company’s name, as it is described in this market group, comes first in alphabetical order (e.g. if both were tied, Apple would resolve to “Yes” and NVIDIA would resolve to “No”).\n\nThe resolution source for this market is NASDAQ, specifically the exchange-certified Close values published at https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical. If this resolution source is unavailable, another resolution source will be chosen.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-30T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-30","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"5","groupItemTitle":"Meta Platforms (META)","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-meta-platforms-meta-be-the-top-performing-magnificent-7-company-during-the-week-of-december-8-OBz6Q9jN5yWm.jpg","id":"1250051","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-meta-platforms-meta-be-the-top-performing-magnificent-7-company-during-the-week-of-december-8-OBz6Q9jN5yWm.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.07,"liquidity":"237.5934","liquidityClob":237.5934,"liquidityNum":237.5934,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x20667c5353bb7d5f3acf080a9798738e72ac493be207bdf2c3797046d8210900","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xeed1ff79b515d9d81b33284dbf0a69442f37b52ccdd26aa80b19c8cbe8e70e4b","new":false,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.2\", \"0.8\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Meta Platforms (META) be the top performing Magnificent 7 company during the week of January 26?","questionID":"0x20667c5353bb7d5f3acf080a9798738e72ac493be207bdf2c3797046d8210905","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-meta-platforms-meta-be-the-top-performing-magnificent-7-company-during-the-week-of-january-26","spread":0.28,"startDate":"2026-01-23T23:25:36.725976Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-23","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:21:27.272926Z","volume":"25.95","volume1mo":25.949999999999996,"volume1moClob":25.949999999999996,"volume1wk":25.949999999999996,"volume1wkClob":25.949999999999996,"volume1yr":25.949999999999996,"volume1yrClob":25.949999999999996,"volume24hr":25.949999999999996,"volume24hrClob":25.949999999999996,"volumeClob":25.95,"volumeNum":25.95}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x20667c5353bb7d5f3acf080a9798738e72ac493be207bdf2c3797046d8210900","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":7,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:12:18.618635Z","icon":"","id":"10759","image":"","liquidity":1214.0072,"recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"mag-7-weekly","ticker":"mag-7-weekly","title":"mag 7 weekly","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:19:32.287309Z","volume":689.793331}],"seriesSlug":"mag-7-weekly","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"top-performing-magnificent-7-company-week-of-january-26","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-23T23:25:45.202492Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2026-01-05T19:17:58.621353Z","id":"103061","label":"mag 7","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mag-7","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:11:15.607284Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:12:50.658365Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-30T17:42:57.5Z","forceShow":false,"id":"604","isCarousel":false,"label":"Stocks","publishedAt":"2023-11-30 17:42:57.475+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"stocks","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T19:20:43.953605Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-23T16:39:54.914957Z","id":"103244","label":"Mag7","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mag7","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T16:40:04.526974Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T23:06:12.324Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1401","label":"Tech","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 23:06:12.305+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tech","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T19:21:38.848861Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-10-14T20:02:08.297777Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102676","isCarousel":false,"label":"Equities","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"equities","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:12:50.720322Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:46:09.386953Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101999","label":"Big Tech","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"big-tech","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T22:12:19.107268Z"}],"ticker":"top-performing-magnificent-7-company-week-of-january-26","title":"Top performing Magnificent 7 company week of January 26?","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:21:57.729918Z","volume":689.793331,"volume1mo":684.991904,"volume1wk":684.991904,"volume1yr":684.991904,"volume24hr":684.991904}
