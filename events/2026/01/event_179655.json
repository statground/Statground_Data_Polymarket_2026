damage.\n\nActions such as artillery fire, small arms fire, FPV or ATGM strikes, ground incursions, naval shelling, cyberattacks, or other operations conducted by the Russian armed forces will not qualify.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official government/military statements (Ukrainian or Russian), multilateral bodies (UN, etc.), or a consensus of credible reporting from major international media and national broadcasters/newspapers.\n\nIf the date/time of a strike cannot be confirmed by a consensus of credible reporting within 48 hours of this market's end date, it will resolve to \"No\" regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":"January
