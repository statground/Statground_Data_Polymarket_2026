Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a qualifying \"strike\" is defined as the use of aerial bombs, drones, or missiles (including cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by Russian Armed Forces that impact Kyiv municipality's ground territory.\n\nA strike on any area within the terrestrial territory of the Kyiv municipality counts.\n\nMissiles or drones that are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution, regardless of whether they land on the Kyiv municipality's territory or cause damage.\n\nActions such as artillery fire, small arms fire, FPV or ATGM strikes, ground incursions, naval shelling, cyberattacks, or other operations conducted by the Russian armed forces will not qualify.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official government/military statements (Ukrainian or Russian), multilateral bodies (UN, etc.), or a consensus of credible reporting from major international media and national broadcasters/newspapers.\n\nIf the date/time of a strike cannot be confirmed by a consensus of credible reporting within 48 hours of this market's end date, it will resolve to \"No\" regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":"January
