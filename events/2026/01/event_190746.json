In this case, a strike will be considered to have occurred in the specified period if it is determined that it occurred in that period, in Eastern Time (timeframes partially, but not fully, in this period will count). Any strike incident announced by AFRICOM after March 4, 2026, 11:59 PM ET will not count, regardless of the timing of the strike.\n\nThis market will remain open until March 4, 2026, 12:00 PM ET. If the date/time of a qualifying strike cannot be confirmed by that time, it will not count, regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) (https://www.africom.mil/media-gallery/press-releases); however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used to determine the timing of an announced strike incident.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-04T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-03-04","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"18-21","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-by-january-31-ZfjWT7qXorC3.jpg","id":"1280183","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-by-january-31-ZfjWT7qXorC3.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.11,"liquidity":"4297.7961","liquidityClob":4297.7961,"liquidityNum":4297.7961,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xbb99e04e49474914eaf2e0fb7cb51e94a1910546813a272e2a84095bc8a97500","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xe0297f569ca4de980ec7e2bece427bbda29048e44384f6107808423d66591077","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.005,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.13\", \"0.87\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will there be between 18 and 21 US strikes on Somalia in February 2026?","questionID":"0xbb99e04e49474914eaf2e0fb7cb51e94a1910546813a272e2a84095bc8a97504","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-there-be-between-18-and-21-us-strikes-on-somalia-in-february-2026","spread":0.02,"startDate":"2026-01-28T00:23:39.714782Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-28","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T01:17:02.573416Z","volume":"7649.031702","volume1mo":7649.031701999997,"volume1moClob":7649.031701999997,"volume1wk":7649.031701999997,"volume1wkClob":7649.031701999997,"volume1yr":7649.031701999997,"volume1yrClob":7649.031701999997,"volume24hr":2657.8172319999994,"volume24hrClob":2657.8172319999994,"volumeClob":7649.031702,"volumeNum":7649.031702}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xbb99e04e49474914eaf2e0fb7cb51e94a1910546813a272e2a84095bc8a97500","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":354,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:32:03.75467Z","icon":"","id":"10893","image":"","liquidity":51725.49094,"recurrence":"daily","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"us-strike-on-somalia","ticker":"us-strike-on-somalia","title":"U.S. strike on Somalia","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T01:16:00.882807Z","volume":107216.714841}],"seriesSlug":"us-strike-on-somalia","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-in-february","startDate":"2026-01-28T00:25:01.842313Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:10:34.896001Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T19:00:55.849904Z","id":"103284","label":"AFRICOM","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"africom","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T19:05:02.907605Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:51.838963Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-05T22:14:31.922993Z","id":"103063","label":"somalia","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"somalia","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:45.828392Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-in-february","title":"How many times will the US strike Somalia in February?","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T01:17:50.474795Z","volume":65682.133007,"volume1mo":65672.133007,"volume1wk":65672.133007,"volume1yr":65672.133007,"volume24hr":17156.234016000002}
