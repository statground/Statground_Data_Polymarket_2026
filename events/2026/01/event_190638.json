For the 68th Annual GRAMMY Awards, nominations are scheduled for November 7, 2025, and the ceremony for February 1, 2026.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the listed term is mentioned by anyone during the scheduled broadcast of the Grammys on CBS. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf prerecorded clips are aired where people are speaking, those clips will count toward this market's resolution.\n\nCommercials which are not part of the show itself will not qualify toward this market's resolution.\n\nAI-generated audio or video will count toward this market's resolution.\n\nAny usage of the term, regardless of context, will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market; however, other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nIf no such stream is aired by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the official CBS broadcast of this event.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-01T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-01","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"9","groupItemTitle":"Gay / Queer","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-be-said-during-the-grammys-gtNrQjm18Ppw.jpg","id":"1279774","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-be-said-during-the-grammys-gtNrQjm18Ppw.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.018,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.0465,"oneHourPriceChange":-0.002,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will \"Gay\" or \"Queer\" be said at the Grammys?","questionID":"0xe1b37913860c5e2324dda399fab615ffbd68a1c9e42c1fdd3533fbb207b54156","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-gay-or-queer-be-said-at-the-grammys","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2026-01-27T22:31:07.632355Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-27","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2026-02-03T17:32:44Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[\"proposed\"]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-04T16:23:56.887536Z","volume":"2001.631996","volume1mo":2001.631996,"volume1moClob":2001.631996,"volume1wk":2001.631996,"volume1wkClob":2001.631996,"volume1yr":2001.631996,"volume1yrClob":2001.631996,"volumeClob":2001.631996,"volumeNum":2001.631996}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-be-said-during-the-grammys","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-27T20:39:05.773068Z","startTime":"2026-02-01T22:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-01-26T19:11:31.63Z","createdBy":15,"forceShow":false,"id":"924","label":"Grammys","publishedAt":"2024-01-26 19:11:32.986+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"grammys","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:08:02.384529Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2023-11-29T18:40:14.63Z","forceShow":false,"id":"596","label":"Culture","publishedAt":"2023-11-29 18:40:13.013+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"pop-culture","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:11.016562Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:03:41.713Z","forceShow":false,"id":"18","label":"Awards","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:03:41.709+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"awards","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:08:02.357369Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:19:29.066Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100","label":"Music","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:19:29.061+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"music","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:15:10.36042Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:48:48.383Z","forceShow":false,"id":"286","label":"Celebrities","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:48:48.368+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"celebrities","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:02:01.212625Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-16T02:29:11.548984Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100343","label":"Mentions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mention-markets","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:31.098746Z"}],"ticker":"what-will-be-said-during-the-grammys","title":"What will be said during the Grammys?","updatedAt":"2026-02-21T06:28:08.277719Z","volume":44570.894506,"volume1mo":44570.894506,"volume1wk":44562.30221,"volume1yr":44570.894506,"volume24hr":15.151514}
