The final Billboard Hot 100 song chart relevant to this market will be the Chart titled “Week of January 9, 2027” for a data collection reference period of December 25-31, 2026.\n\nUpdates or revisions made within this market’s timeframe to the #1-ranked song on previously published Billboard Hot 100 charts will be considered; however, such updates will not disqualify a previously published Billboard Hot 100 #1 song from counting. If a Billboard Hot 100 #1 song is revised after initial publication, both the originally published #1 song and the revised #1 song will count for this market. Updates or revisions made after the release of the final Billboard Hot 100 song chart relevant to this market will not be considered.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the weekly Billboard Hot 100 songs charts published each week at https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ and through other official Billboard channels.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-12-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-12-31","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"27","groupItemTitle":"Mariah Carey","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/which-artists-will-have-a-billboard-1-song-this-year-AUdT-nz1bQMa.jpg","id":"1138614","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/which-artists-will-have-a-billboard-1-song-this-year-AUdT-nz1bQMa.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.8,"liquidity":"1839.2258","liquidityClob":1839.2258,"liquidityNum":1839.2258,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneMonthPriceChange":0.03,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.015,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.825\", \"0.175\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Mariah Carey have a #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2026?","questionID":"0x4cec3bec6a4233899b4038dd82e798c43aafc56b02bdb1459a81e6d4898696e1","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-mariah-carey-have-a-1-song-on-the-billboard-hot-100-in-2026","spread":0.05,"startDate":"2026-01-09T21:30:01.931339Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-09","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T01:18:58.020635Z","volume":"1500.074775","volume1mo":353.797732,"volume1moClob":353.797732,"volume1wk":5.82,"volume1wkClob":5.82,"volume1yr":1500.0747750000003,"volume1yrClob":1500.0747750000003,"volumeClob":1500.074775,"volumeNum":1500.074775}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"which-artists-will-have-a-billboard-1-song-this-year","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-09T21:31:24.902793Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:19:29.066Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100","label":"Music","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:19:29.061+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"music","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:15:10.36042Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-29T18:40:14.63Z","forceShow":false,"id":"596","label":"Culture","publishedAt":"2023-11-29 18:40:13.013+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"pop-culture","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:11.016562Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-07T16:54:22.109065Z","id":"103077","label":"billboard","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"billboard","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T19:58:53.256474Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-07T16:54:22.058683Z","id":"103076","label":"hot 100","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"hot-100","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:13:40.219643Z"}],"ticker":"which-artists-will-have-a-billboard-1-song-this-year","title":"Which artists will have a Billboard #1 song this year?","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T01:17:35.550348Z","volume":85560.729084,"volume1mo":25445.951047000002,"volume1wk":10589.069126,"volume1yr":85560.729084,"volume24hr":2353.3927}
