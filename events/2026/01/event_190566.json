Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nAI-generated content will not be considered when resolving this market.\n\nIf no such press briefing happens by February 28, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market refers to White House press briefings by the acting White House Press Secretary (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). Any press briefing by the acting White House Press Secretary will qualify. \"New Media\" press briefings or special briefings such as those including extra guests will be considered, so long as the acting White House Press Secretary  is a listed participant. Impromptu press gaggles will not be considered for the resolution of this market; only events listed on the public schedule as briefings or announcements will qualify.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be footage of the relevant briefing.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-28T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-28","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"18","groupItemTitle":"Putin","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-karoline-leavitt-say-during-the-next-white-house-press-briefing-634-T6l8HXSqXqId.jpg","id":"1278731","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-karoline-leavitt-say-during-the-next-white-house-press-briefing-634-T6l8HXSqXqId.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.25,"liquidity":"205.365","liquidityClob":205.365,"liquidityNum":205.365,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.02,"oneHourPriceChange":-0.015,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.325\", \"0.675\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Leavitt say \"Putin\" during the next press briefing?","questionID":"0x4c09d51a44fca2a89f65c8e3d9edfe24ce4a70142c00d9bec7336e6d406fadc2","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-leavitt-say-putin-during-the-next-press-briefing","spread":0.21,"startDate":"2026-01-27T18:05:32.184545Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-27","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T01:18:55.279588Z","volume":"266.839812","volume1mo":266.839812,"volume1moClob":266.839812,"volume1wk":266.839812,"volume1wkClob":266.839812,"volume1yr":266.839812,"volume1yrClob":266.839812,"volumeClob":266.839812,"volumeNum":266.839812}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-karoline-leavitt-say-during-the-next-white-house-press-briefing-634","startDate":"2026-01-27T18:09:05.959272Z","startTime":"2026-02-06T12:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T18:00:55.375578Z","id":"103281","label":"leavitt","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"leavitt","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T18:05:00.672732Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:10:34.896001Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-08-16T02:29:11.548984Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100343","label":"Mentions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mention-markets","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:35:39.767573Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"what-will-karoline-leavitt-say-during-the-next-white-house-press-briefing-634","title":"What will Karoline Leavitt say during the next White House press briefing?","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T01:19:26.526619Z","volume":5558.480083,"volume1mo":5549.4800829999995,"volume1wk":5549.4800829999995,"volume1yr":5549.4800829999995,"volume24hr":647.454468}
