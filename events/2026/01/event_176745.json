Who be confirmed as the next Fed Chair?\nThis market will resolve according to the next individual confirmed by the U.S. Senate to be Chair of the Federal Reserve by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET.\n\nConfirmation is defined as approval by the U.S. Senate, whether by a majority vote or by unanimous consent.\n\nRecess appointments without Senate confirmation will not count toward a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nActing or interim appointments will not count unless the individual is confirmed by the U.S. Senate to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the U.S. Senate (see: https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations_new.htm); however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\n2. Will the Fed’s lower bound reach 2.5% or lower in 2026?\nThe FED interest rates are defined in this market by the lower bound of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve according to whether the lower bound of the target federal funds rate reaches 2.5% at any point by December 31, 2026, 12:59 PM ET.\n\nEmergency rate cuts and hikes outside the regularly scheduled meetings will be considered.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the official website of the Federal Reserve at:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nNote: If the lower bound of the target federal funds rate reaches 2.5% before a new Fed Chair is nominated, it will qualify.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-12-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-12-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"7","groupItemTitle":"Christopher Waller & Rate > 2.5%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-trump-nominate-as-fed-chair-9p19ttRwsbKL.png","id":"1227351","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-trump-nominate-as-fed-chair-9p19ttRwsbKL.png","lastTradePrice":0.08,"liquidity":"8104.5316","liquidityClob":8104.5316,"liquidityNum":8104.5316,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x5c2035f4efb2c75f1e88461e22e159c490051002e7d656c7481e4196564db900","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xcf54d976439ad1fe6e345698b42c365b6ad7f77014f161bd7025a3bc9ea8f250","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.035,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.08\", \"0.92\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Christopher Waller be confirmed as Fed Chair and will rates stay above 2.5% in 2026?","questionID":"0x5c2035f4efb2c75f1e88461e22e159c490051002e7d656c7481e4196564db907","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":50,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-christopher-waller-be-confirmed-as-fed-chair-and-will-rates-stay-above-2pt5-in-2026-719","spread":0.02,"startDate":"2026-01-20T13:29:58.421085Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-20","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T18:30:48.539065Z","volume":"135","volume1mo":135,"volume1moClob":135,"volume1wk":135,"volume1wkClob":135,"volume1yr":135,"volume1yrClob":135,"volume24hr":80,"volume24hrClob":80,"volumeClob":135,"volumeNum":135},{"acceptingOrders":true,"acceptingOrdersTimestamp":"2026-01-20T13:29:46Z","active":true,"approved":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"bestAsk":0.09,"bestBid":0.07,"clearBookOnStart":true,"clobTokenIds":"[\"68913153540574314749415284055691780290306094084209478229942172031873972067947\", \"10980869689964921227047480431023635246637317983901031741233635278193625249458\"]","closed":false,"competitive":0.8500510030601836,"conditionId":"0xbb676d25a7ce355a3a10fa2bfbee5cb7b6b2ee36581ada7914d73ad78bedf62d","createdAt":"2026-01-20T13:26:53.956659Z","customLiveness":0,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"deployingTimestamp":"2026-01-20T13:27:52.415003Z","description":"This market will resolve according to the combined outcome of who will be confirmed as the next Fed Chair and whether the Fed’s lower bound will reach 2.5% or lower (https://polymarket.com/event/what-will-fed-rate-hit-before-2027) at any point by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Other” if an outcome not listed occurs within the specified timeframe.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the respective conditions are met.\n\nThe rules and resolution criteria are as follows:\n\n1.
