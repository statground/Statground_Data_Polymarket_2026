Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the listed term will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nAI-generated audio or video will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nThis market is explicitly about Donald Trump's scheduled delivery of the 2026 State of the Union address. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of the named, scheduled event will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by February 28, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events. Only remarks which are broadcast or streamed live will count toward this market's resolution.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-24T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-24","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"36","groupItemTitle":"Biden","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-people-will-trump-mention-during-the-state-of-the-union-address-YUEQMHN3vFTb.jpg","id":"1230041","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-people-will-trump-mention-during-the-state-of-the-union-address-YUEQMHN3vFTb.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.9,"liquidity":"2708.1188","liquidityClob":2708.1188,"liquidityNum":2708.1188,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.005,"oneWeekPriceChange":0.025,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.92\", \"0.08\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Trump say \"Biden\" during the State of the Union address?","questionID":"0xd1966d85e6e15f6a0eafcd1521d4b72675a82964172a391fb29df678f7b0aa40","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-trump-say-biden-during-the-state-of-the-union-address-567","spread":0.04,"startDate":"2026-01-20T21:03:07.398983Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-20","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T18:29:06.186152Z","volume":"829.823035","volume1mo":829.8230349999999,"volume1moClob":829.8230349999999,"volume1wk":644.92,"volume1wkClob":644.92,"volume1yr":829.8230349999999,"volume1yrClob":829.8230349999999,"volume24hr":161.09,"volume24hrClob":161.09,"volumeClob":829.823035,"volumeNum":829.823035}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"who-will-trump-name-during-the-state-of-the-union-address","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-20T21:03:29.316355Z","startTime":"2026-02-24T12:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:10:34.896001Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-08-16T02:29:11.548984Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100343","label":"Mentions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mention-markets","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:35:39.767573Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"who-will-trump-name-during-the-state-of-the-union-address","title":"Who will Trump name during the State of the Union address?","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T18:29:18.536112Z","volume":40807.699581,"volume1mo":40714.761787,"volume1wk":18831.07344,"volume1yr":40714.761787,"volume24hr":2070.144624}
