Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market, an “episode” must be listed as a distinct episode of Stranger Things on Netflix and be playable for general subscribers in the United States. A behind-the-scenes featurette, documentary, trailer, recap, cast interview, deleted scenes compilation, or other bonus content will not count unless it is clearly presented by Netflix as an official numbered or titled episode of the series.\n\nIf Netflix releases an alternate cut, extended cut, or “secret” version of an already-released episode, it will not count unless it is listed as a separate episode entry on Netflix.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the Stranger Things title page on Netflix (episode list and availability), however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-07T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-07","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"February 28","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/new-stranger-things-episode-released-by-wednesday-4NShFZwCps4u.jpg","id":"1278048","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/new-stranger-things-episode-released-by-wednesday-4NShFZwCps4u.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.009,"liquidity":"127662.70486","liquidityClob":127662.70486,"liquidityNum":127662.70486,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneHourPriceChange":0.0005,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0085\", \"0.9915\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"New \"Stranger Things\" episode released by February 28?
