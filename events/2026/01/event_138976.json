This market may not resolve to “No” until the Employment Situation report for December 2026 is released. If no Employment Situation Report for December 2026 is released by March 31, 2027, 11:59 PM ET, however, this market will resolve based on all previously published data up to that time. \n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Monthly Employment Situation Report, published by the BLS every month at https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/empsit.htm, specifically the U-3 measure in Table A-15 for each month.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market reports unemployment to one decimal point. Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-10T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-10","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"10.0%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/march-unemployment-rate-wpcB-Q7lTi_r.jpg","id":"1087313","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/march-unemployment-rate-wpcB-Q7lTi_r.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.05,"liquidity":"7744.035","liquidityClob":7744.035,"liquidityNum":7744.035,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.055\", \"0.945\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will US unemployment reach at least 10.0% in 2026?","questionID":"0x0128ec303e994434ccc9353b8b5280c5ac79068c612ed7d712a155b5917ba349","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":50,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-us-unemployment-reach-at-least-10pt0-in-2026","spread":0.01,"startDate":"2026-01-02T18:54:51.410606Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-02","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:25:21.748524Z","volume":"621.792612","volume1mo":616.5326120000001,"volume1moClob":616.5326120000001,"volume1wk":616.5326120000001,"volume1wkClob":616.5326120000001,"volume1yr":616.5326120000001,"volume1yrClob":616.5326120000001,"volumeClob":621.792612,"volumeNum":621.792612}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-high-will-us-unemployment-go-in-2026","startDate":"2026-01-02T18:56:04.53782Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:18:12.825123Z","id":"102964","label":"NFP","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"nfp","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:19:35.935641Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-11T22:41:09.272Z","id":"1624","label":"unemployment","publishedAt":"2024-03-11 22:41:09.266+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"unemployment","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:59.752755Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:57:53.430333Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102000","label":"Macro Indicators","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"macro-indicators","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:07:16.862383Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:18:12.942636Z","id":"102965","label":"nonfarm payroll","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"nonfarm-payroll","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:19:55.653955Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:47:59.485621Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-10-08T14:42:58.082638Z","id":"100765","label":"bls","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"bls","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:57:45.937002Z"}],"ticker":"how-high-will-us-unemployment-go-in-2026","title":"How high will US unemployment go in 2026?","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:28:11.218274Z","volume":10735.066679,"volume1mo":10712.806681999999,"volume1wk":10712.806681999999,"volume1yr":10712.806681999999,"volume24hr":1113.6314730000001}
