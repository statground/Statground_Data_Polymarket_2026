If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results as reported by the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (interior.gov.lb).\n\nNote: If a listed party contests the election as part of a jointly listed coalition with one or more parties not listed in this market, the market corresponding to the listed party will represent the coalition and will count all seats won by the coalition collectively. If two or more listed parties contest the election as a jointly listed coalition, with or without additional parties not listed in this market, the market corresponding to the party within that coalition that won the most seats in the previous election will represent the coalition and will count all seats won by the coalition collectively. If such a coalition dissolves, each market will again represent its respective party individually.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-05-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-05-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"43","groupItemTitle":"Party T","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lebanon-parliamentary-election-winner-AF5OglvfrqjC.png","id":"1124692","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lebanon-parliamentary-election-winner-AF5OglvfrqjC.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":true,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xa0a14e8a5f4510c887f5cc0a374c7a20c74e333a1d256ad63fc595839cf56000","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x58b61cfc81cdfe2327ddf0007975daa6802910d3014aaa922a598eb486de2155","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Party T win the most seats in the 2026 Lebanese parliamentary election?","questionID":"0xa0a14e8a5f4510c887f5cc0a374c7a20c74e333a1d256ad63fc595839cf5602b","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-party-t-win-the-most-seats-in-the-2026-lebanese-parliamentary-election","spread":1,"startDate":"2026-01-06T22:00:45.772028Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T20:26:43.100328Z","volume":"0","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume24hrAmm":0,"volume24hrClob":0,"volumeAmm":0,"volumeClob":0,"volumeNum":0}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xa0a14e8a5f4510c887f5cc0a374c7a20c74e333a1d256ad63fc595839cf56000","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"lebanon-parliamentary-election-winner","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-06T22:02:28.810244Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:26:20.601Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"154","label":"Middle East","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:26:20.585+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"middle-east","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:03:26.068462Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-01-09T20:34:03.207Z","forceShow":false,"id":"849","label":"Lebanon","publishedAt":"2024-01-09 20:34:03.181+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"lebanon","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:06:46.45917Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-07T20:41:56.773Z","createdBy":15,"forceShow":true,"id":"1597","label":"Global Elections","publishedAt":"2024-03-07 20:44:01.258+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"global-elections","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:14.333775Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-11-07T23:07:25.512144Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101206","label":"World Elections","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"world-elections","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:23:52.246631Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:24:31.198Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"144","label":"Elections","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:24:31.008+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"elections","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:21:41.568669Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"lebanon-parliamentary-election-winner","title":"Lebanon Parliamentary Election Winner","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T06:35:11.321487Z","volume":10590.686889,"volume1mo":10582.701389,"volume1wk":2467.201943,"volume1yr":10582.701389,"volume24hr":76.5925}
