The market will resolve based on the first relevant tornado count published on the NCEI tornado time-series page after this scheduled release time.\n\nIf the value published after this scheduled release time is labeled preliminary, it will still determine resolution, and the market will resolve independently of any subsequent revisions, corrections, or retroactive adjustments. \n\nThe market will not resolve based on any preliminary values published before the scheduled release time.\n\nIf no data is published by the scheduled release time, or if the NCEI website is temporarily unavailable, this market will remain open until that data is made available. If the relevant data is not made available by the date of the next scheduled publication ET, this market will resolve based on available data for the most recent prior month. If the NCEI website becomes permanently unavailable, this market will resolve using another credible source.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-10T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-03-10","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemRange":"[\"90\", \"119\"]","groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"90–119","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-tornadoes-in-the-us-in-november-W7XLO0OomR-x.png","id":"1299154","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-tornadoes-in-the-us-in-november-W7XLO0OomR-x.png","liquidity":"367.7295","liquidityClob":367.7295,"liquidityNum":367.7295,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x347a0d15f7b91e2146c12b6907197b03e4a7161b7a06562d6efbb6ba1864ab00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xe66dd6d05c3549a2567258d748fab0798524d3a9fe3054ea6e3113a6b1686e16","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.575,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.425\", \"0.575\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will 90 to 119 tornadoes occur in the United States in February 2026?","questionID":"0x347a0d15f7b91e2146c12b6907197b03e4a7161b7a06562d6efbb6ba1864ab03","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-90-to-119-tornadoes-occur-in-the-united-states-in-february-2026","spread":0.73,"startDate":"2026-01-30T22:50:02.123982Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-30","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T18:18:38.857629Z"}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x347a0d15f7b91e2146c12b6907197b03e4a7161b7a06562d6efbb6ba1864ab00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":90,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T16:53:38.450446Z","icon":"","id":"10724","image":"","liquidity":17197.2523,"recurrence":"daily","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"monthly-tornadoes-us","ticker":"monthly-tornadoes-us","title":"Monthly Tornadoes US","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T18:19:36.183603Z","volume":506574.945431}],"seriesSlug":"monthly-tornadoes-us","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-many-tornadoes-in-the-us-in-february","startDate":"2026-01-30T22:51:31.528551Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:17:34.814Z","forceShow":false,"id":"84","label":"Weather","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:17:34.81+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"weather","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:24:50.868968Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:16:20.826Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"74","label":"Science","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:16:20.623+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"science","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:05:27.339038Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-11-13T16:11:46.556Z","forceShow":false,"id":"496","isCarousel":false,"label":"Natural Disasters","publishedAt":"2023-11-13 16:11:46.538+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"natural-disasters","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:19:06.030898Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-12-30T23:31:52.33537Z","forceShow":false,"id":"103037","isCarousel":false,"label":"Climate & Science","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"climate-science","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:18:27.961228Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-tornadoes-in-the-us-in-february","title":"How many Tornadoes in the US in February?","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T18:19:28.534789Z","volume":1.04165,"volume1mo":1.04165,"volume1wk":1.04165,"volume1yr":1.04165,"volume24hr":1.04165}
