The 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada, which removed the existing regime from power, would count.\n\nNon-qualifying examples (would not count): The 2011 removal of Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya, however, in which the United States Military took part in a NATO operation against the Libyan military, including qualifying actions of force, but Gaddafi was removed by Libyan anti-government forces rather than U.S. government forces, would not count. The 1994 U.S.-led intervention in Haiti, in which the military regime relinquished power through negotiated departure rather than being forcibly removed from power by United States government forces as defined above, would not count.
