towards the country where the embassy or consulate is located, not towards the country they represent.\n\nStrikes within the territory controlled by the US at the time of market creation will not be counted toward this market's resolution.\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a qualifying \"strike\" is defined as the use of aerial bombs, drones, or missiles (including cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by US military forces that impact another country's ground territory that is officially acknowledged by the US government or a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nMissiles or drones that are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not count towards the resolution of this market, regardless of whether they land on another country's territory or cause damage.\n\nActions such as artillery fire, small arms fire, FPV or ATGM strikes directly, ground incursions, naval shelling, cyberattacks, or other operations conducted by US ground operatives will not qualify.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"≥7","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-different-countries-will-the-us-strike-in-january-9d2loC8vZsDk.png","id":"1228376","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-different-countries-will-the-us-strike-in-january-9d2loC8vZsDk.png","lastTradePrice":0.03,"liquidity":"1227.11072","liquidityClob":1227.11072,"liquidityNum":1227.11072,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x7fb81be445d8a858454ffd6a75dd58e2ec882f8673759394eea29ba86a864200","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xe078c1d1e4d9b411a0730d05600940a0988a5b9aff4d8f077942683330ee4d3e","new":false,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0195\",
