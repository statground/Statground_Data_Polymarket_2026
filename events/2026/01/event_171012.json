Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nFor the purpose of this market, \"goes into effect\" means the start date for the tariffs must have occurred without being further delayed or suspended.\n\nA new general tariff that includes item-specific exceptions will still qualify, as long as a new policy of a general tariff on imports into the United States from the listed country goes into effect.\n\nOnly new tariffs specifically targeting the listed country or a specific set of countries including the listed country will qualify. For example, a new global tariff (tariffs on all imports into the U.S. from any country) will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nAn increase in the rate of pre-existing general tariffs on imports into the US from the listed country will count.\n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible information may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-01T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-02-01","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"Germany","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/which-countries-will-trumps-greenland-tariffs-go-into-effect-for-by-feb-1-yXOxQpWJyd5t.jpg","id":"1210045","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/which-countries-will-trumps-greenland-tariffs-go-into-effect-for-by-feb-1-yXOxQpWJyd5t.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.011,"liquidity":"4992.92004","liquidityClob":4992.92004,"liquidityNum":4992.92004,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.0035,"oneHourPriceChange":-0.004,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.2465,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0085\", \"0.9915\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Trump’s Greenland Tariffs go into effect for Germany by Feburary 1?","questionID":"0x8a5dde86d2a0381401f38463e7a6f7f2216984add31eac0eaa70dd46f0f16d2e","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-trumps-greenland-tariffs-go-into-effect-for-germany-by-feburary-1","spread":0.003,"startDate":"2026-01-18T01:42:22.867677Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-18","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T12:29:18.681298Z","volume":"39003.898013","volume1mo":38992.74801300001,"volume1moClob":38992.74801300001,"volume1wk":17289.298978999992,"volume1wkClob":17289.298978999992,"volume1yr":38992.74801300001,"volume1yrClob":38992.74801300001,"volume24hr":313.144013,"volume24hrClob":313.144013,"volumeClob":39003.898013,"volumeNum":39003.898013}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"which-countries-will-trumps-greenland-tariffs-go-into-effect-for-by-feb-1","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-18T01:43:22.825634Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:12:07.062835Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-09-03T23:38:52.652644Z","id":"100410","label":"Europe","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"europe","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:14:33.352053Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2024-12-23T16:03:09.321825Z","id":"101569","label":"Greenland","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"greenland","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:19:23.032811Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:51.838963Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:10:34.896001Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2025-02-02T18:39:54.837002Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101758","label":"Tariffs","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tariffs","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:18:52.515718Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-02-02T19:17:11.9689Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101761","label":"Trade War","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trade-war","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:01:33.504691Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-21T00:05:07.639541Z","forceShow":false,"id":"103212","isCarousel":false,"label":"Davos","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"davos","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:04:42.642081Z"}],"ticker":"which-countries-will-trumps-greenland-tariffs-go-into-effect-for-by-feb-1","title":"Which countries will Trump’s Greenland Tariffs go into effect for by Feb 1?","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T12:29:54.859129Z","volume":350697.615788,"volume1mo":349860.09719000006,"volume1wk":203900.73782799998,"volume1yr":349860.09719000006,"volume24hr":5341.405652}
