If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results reported by Russian government sources such as the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation.\n\nNote: If a listed party contests the election as part of a jointly listed coalition with one or more parties not listed in this market, the market corresponding to the listed party will represent the coalition and will count all seats won by the coalition collectively. If two or more listed parties contest the election as a jointly listed coalition, with or without additional parties not listed in this market, the market corresponding to the party within that coalition that won the most seats in the previous election will represent the coalition and will count all seats won by the coalition collectively. If such a coalition dissolves, each market will again represent its respective party individually.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-09-30T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-09-30","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"31","groupItemTitle":"Party X","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/russia-parliamentary-election-winner-MnZ1Lsh2uVMq.png","id":"1129939","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/russia-parliamentary-election-winner-MnZ1Lsh2uVMq.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":true,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x5dd3c57e95e4b3d29722ae868668bc2e0848028a1d26974efa6081d26ad12200","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x5858492a2d5c87ba6d91f7372aa853836bd50829a5cbf0658c6b5dc4f9edb0bb","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Party X win the most seats in the next Russian parliamentary election?","questionID":"0x5dd3c57e95e4b3d29722ae868668bc2e0848028a1d26974efa6081d26ad1221f","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-party-x-win-the-most-seats-in-the-next-russian-parliamentary-election","spread":1,"startDate":"2026-01-07T21:28:06.627836Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T20:29:00.797101Z","volume":"0","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume24hrAmm":0,"volume24hrClob":0,"volumeAmm":0,"volumeClob":0,"volumeNum":0}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x5dd3c57e95e4b3d29722ae868668bc2e0848028a1d26974efa6081d26ad12200","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"russia-parliamentary-election-winner","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2026-01-07T21:29:19.718996Z","startTime":"2026-09-20T00:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:46:19.528Z","id":"270","label":"putin","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:46:19.507+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"putin","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:03:02.535284Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:18:49.32Z","id":"95","label":"russia","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:18:49.314+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"russia","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:08:05.606856Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-19T23:36:08.498099Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101970","label":"World","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"world","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:25:05.462266Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:24:31.198Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"144","label":"Elections","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:24:31.008+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"elections","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:21:41.568669Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2024-11-07T23:07:25.512144Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101206","label":"World Elections","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"world-elections","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:23:52.246631Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-07T20:41:56.773Z","createdBy":15,"forceShow":true,"id":"1597","label":"Global Elections","publishedAt":"2024-03-07 20:44:01.258+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"global-elections","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:14.333775Z","updatedBy":15}],"ticker":"russia-parliamentary-election-winner","title":"Russia Parliamentary Election Winner","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T06:21:20.94058Z","volume":8943.241417,"volume1mo":8943.241417,"volume1wk":2384.5015399999997,"volume1yr":8943.241417}
