Otherwise, it will resolve to “No”.\n\nIf no IPO occurs by December 31, 2027, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nMarket capitalization is defined as the total number of outstanding shares multiplied by the closing share price on the first trading day.\n\nResolution will be based on the primary exchange’s official listing page. In the event that the relevant figure is not displayed, another reliable source will be used.\n\nIn the event of an interruption in the course of the normal trading session on OpenAI's first day of trading (e.g., a circuit breaker or half-day), the market will resolve according to the official closing price of the abbreviated session. If no such official closing price is published, the market will resolve according to the next trading day on which an official closing price is published, treating that as the first day of trading.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2027-12-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2027-12-31","featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemRange":"[\"1400000000000\", \"1600000000000\"]","groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"$1.4T","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/openai-ipo-closing-market-cap-RiLs850YpL5k.png","id":"1298658","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/openai-ipo-closing-market-cap-RiLs850YpL5k.png","lastTradePrice":0.14,"liquidity":"1808.0217","liquidityClob":1808.0217,"liquidityNum":1808.0217,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.01,"oneWeekPriceChange":0.005,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.12\", \"0.88\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"OpenAI IPO closing market cap above $1.4T?","questionID":"0xba444d4b918a3f718fd52b7d31c35a38ea8007e9c237da80d5e3c21ba6d866f1","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"openai-ipo-closing-market-cap-above-1pt4t","spread":0.04,"startDate":"2026-01-31T00:27:29.681096Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-31","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T18:38:45.110151Z","volume":"11672.858005","volume1mo":11636.706578,"volume1moClob":11636.706578,"volume1wk":2310.24111,"volume1wkClob":2310.24111,"volume1yr":11636.706578,"volume1yrClob":11636.706578,"volume24hr":13.92,"volume24hrClob":13.92,"volumeClob":11672.858005,"volumeNum":11672.858005}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"openai-ipo-closing-market-cap-above","startDate":"2026-01-31T00:29:13.104948Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:40.097768Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-30T16:53:29.141Z","forceShow":false,"id":"600","label":"IPOs","publishedAt":"2023-11-30 16:53:29.136+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ipos","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:09:32.705813Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-17T23:46:12.878Z","id":"537","label":"OpenAI","publishedAt":"2023-11-17 23:46:12.865+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"openai","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:07:12.294146Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T23:08:32.49Z","forceShow":true,"id":"439","isCarousel":true,"label":"AI","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 23:08:32.469+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ai","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:51.126491Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T23:06:12.324Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1401","label":"Tech","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 23:06:12.305+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:17:30.722289Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:48:43.95Z","forceShow":false,"id":"285","label":"sam altman","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:48:43.94+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"sam-altman","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:31.095549Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:46:09.386953Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101999","label":"Big Tech","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"big-tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:23:51.153305Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:20:37.488Z","forceShow":false,"id":"107","label":"Business","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:20:37.48+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"business","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.874409Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-09-17T00:03:12.42045Z","id":"102599","label":"IPO","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ipo","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:11.130376Z"}],"ticker":"openai-ipo-closing-market-cap-above","title":"OpenAI IPO closing market cap above ___ ?","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T18:39:43.444551Z","volume":97941.637832,"volume1mo":96032.869662,"volume1wk":51309.787243,"volume1yr":96032.869662,"volume24hr":21645.871523}
