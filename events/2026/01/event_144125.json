The index with the best percentage return will be deemed the winner.\n\nThe resolution source for the Warren Buffett Index (\"Buffett\") is https://web.dubapp.com/portfolios/index/559450392165007360\n\nThe resolution source for the Bill Ackman Index (\"Ackman\") is: https://web.dubapp.com/portfolios/index/559452008356167680\n\nInformation from the \"Performance\" tables for the Warren Buffett Index and the Bill Ackman Index, specifically the 1-week trailing percentage return figures found under \"1W\", will be used to resolve this market, once information is finalized for the final day of the specified week.\n\nThe resolution source for S&P 500 (\"SPX\") is: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/SPX/historical-prices\n\nInformation from the \"Historical Prices\" table will be used to resolve this market, specifically the 1-week trailing percentage return calculated as the percentage change between the closing price for the final trading day of the specified week and the closing price for the corresponding day of the previous week (e.g. if the final trading day of the specified week is a Thursday, the closing price of the previous Thursday will be used to calculate the 1-week trailing percentage return). Note that all relevant figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.\n\nIf multiple indices perform exactly the same over this market’s timeframe, this market will resolve according to the Index whose abbreviation comes first, as listed in this market group. \n\nIf the specified indices do not trade at all during the regular session, the market will resolve to “Other”.\n\nIf either of the relevant trading days are shortened (for example, due to a market holiday schedule), the official closing price or 1-week trailing percentage return figure published for each relevant index for that shortened session will still be used for resolution.\n\nIf any of the relevant days lack a specified closing price (for example, due to a trading halt into the market close, system issue, delisting, or other disruption), this market will use the last valid historical price offered by the specified resolution sources as the effective closing price for that day. \n\nIf the Warren Buffett Index or the Bill Ackman Index’s 1-week trailing percentage return figure for the last trading day of the specified week is not published by the time that the figure for the first trading day of the next week is published, this market will resolve based on the most recent 1-week trailing percentage return figure published by the specified resolution source for a day prior to the last trading day of the specified week.\n\nUpdates to historical prices or figures displayed by any of the indices subsequent to this market's resolution will not be considered. This market will resolve according to the methodologies utilized by the specified indices as of the resolution time of this market, regardless of whether those methodologies are later updated.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-09T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-09","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"SPX","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buffett+ackman+spx.png","id":"1111204","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buffett+ackman+spx.png","lastTradePrice":0.45,"liquidity":"21.6041","liquidityClob":21.6041,"liquidityNum":21.6041,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x8e0b84cd40b7c0715291de621331be587fc0f97faf9c2c7619186916eb216900","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xbf176054f331874610430a657716a099d23f87a6d812fabf083d6c051d514287","new":false,"oneHourPriceChange":0.01,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.475\", \"0.525\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the S&P 500 have the best performance for the week of January 5?","questionID":"0x8e0b84cd40b7c0715291de621331be587fc0f97faf9c2c7619186916eb216901","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-the-sp-500-have-the-best-performance-for-the-week-of-january-5","spread":0.89,"startDate":"2026-01-05T23:01:56.149097Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-05","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:30:44.281431Z","volume":"11.11111","volume1mo":11.11111,"volume1moClob":11.11111,"volume1wk":11.11111,"volume1wkClob":11.11111,"volume1yr":11.11111,"volume1yrClob":11.11111,"volume24hr":11.11111,"volume24hrClob":11.11111,"volumeClob":11.11111,"volumeNum":11.11111}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x8e0b84cd40b7c0715291de621331be587fc0f97faf9c2c7619186916eb216900","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":0,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:03:35.746224Z","icon":"","id":"10758","image":"","liquidity":74.6836,"recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"buffett-v-ackman-v-sp","ticker":"buffett-v-ackman-v-sp","title":"Buffett v.
