Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nIf the final session is shortened (for example, due to a market-holiday schedule), the official closing price published for that shortened session will still be used for resolution.\n\nIf no official closing price is published for that session (for example, due to a trading halt into the close, system issue, delisting, or other disruption), the market will use the last valid on-exchange trade price of the regular session as the effective closing price.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Yahoo Finance, specifically the Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) \"Close\" prices available at https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/history, published under \"Historical Prices.\"\n\nIn the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, or similar corporate action affecting the listed company during the listed time frame, this market will resolve based on split-adjusted prices as displayed on Yahoo Finance.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-30T21:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-01-30","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"11","groupItemTitle":"$130","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netflix-8304f5fc04.png","id":"1253639","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netflix-8304f5fc04.png","liquidity":"22.3996","liquidityClob":22.3996,"liquidityNum":22.3996,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.47\", \"0.53\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Netflix (NFLX) finish week of January 26 above $130?","questionID":"0x2131675a005ec78b48f59da242faeb3ba31da052176f02d899af5e634173f6b0","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/history","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"nflx-above-130-on-january-30-2026","spread":0.86,"startDate":"2026-01-26T18:05:01.967021Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-26","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"2","updatedAt":"2026-01-26T18:19:16.445757Z"}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/history","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":2,"createdAt":"2025-11-03T16:42:38.684693Z","featured":false,"icon":"","id":"10500","image":"","liquidity":339.9971,"recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"netflix-multi-strikes-weekly","ticker":"netflix-multi-strikes-weekly","title":"Netflix Multi Strikes Weekly","updatedAt":"2026-01-26T18:20:10.117776Z"}],"seriesSlug":"netflix-multi-strikes-weekly","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"nflx-above-on-january-30-2026","startDate":"2026-01-23T23:01:20.006Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2025-10-16T02:25:50.065055Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102696","isCarousel":false,"label":"NFLX","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"nflx","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:38:26.657125Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-10-14T20:02:08.297777Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102676","isCarousel":false,"label":"Equities","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"equities","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:38:25.126461Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-05-09T20:56:58.880785Z","forceShow":true,"id":"102127","isCarousel":false,"label":"Up or Down","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"up-or-down","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:24:18.290741Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:37:56.077596Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-05-23T18:47:07.430147Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102169","isCarousel":false,"label":"Hide From New","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"hide-from-new","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:15:38.978131Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-30T17:42:57.5Z","forceShow":false,"id":"604","isCarousel":false,"label":"Stocks","publishedAt":"2023-11-30 17:42:57.475+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"stocks","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:06:32.890427Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-08-25T15:12:27.701606Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102516","isCarousel":false,"label":"Multi Strikes","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"multi-strikes","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:32:18.906449Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-06-11T21:22:54.932516Z","id":"102264","label":"Weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"weekly","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:32:26.448982Z"}],"ticker":"nflx-above-on-january-30-2026","title":"Will Netflix (NFLX) finish week of January 26 above___?","updatedAt":"2026-01-26T18:20:01.545433Z"}
