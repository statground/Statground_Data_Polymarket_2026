Otherwise this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nA “major closure” is defined as a broad clearance, cancellation, or suspension of commercial flights transiting Iranian Airspace or a major Iranian Airspace region. A qualifying closure must apply generally to flights across the region. Limited cancellations, delays, or other partial closures will not qualify. Limited exceptions to a broad closure, however, will not disqualify such a closure from counting (e.g. exceptions for certain flights pre-approved by the Iranian Civil Aviation Authority may be permitted).
