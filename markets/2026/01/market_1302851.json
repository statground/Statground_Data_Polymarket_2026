Other Ukrainian towns/cities named Dobropillia will not be considered for resolution.\n\nTerritory will be considered captured if any part of Dobropillia is shaded under a below specified layer on the ISW map (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) by the resolution date.
