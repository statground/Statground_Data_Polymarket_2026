Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf neither occurs by July 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nFor the purposes of this market, \"release\" refers to the game becoming publicly available for purchase or download in the US. Early access, beta versions, other forms of pre-release availability, or leaks will not count as an official release. If the release is only for certain consoles (e.g. Xbox Series X/S) it will count.\n\nThe resolution source for the release of GTA VI is official information from Rockstar Games or its parent company, Take-Two Interactive.\n\nIceman refers to the upcoming studio album by Drake of that title, which has been promoted through videos released with the titles “Iceman Episode (1-4)”, and the singles “What Did I Miss”, “Which One”, and “Dog House.”\n\nOfficially released means that Iceman is officially available for download or streaming (not including live events) by the resolution date.\n\nThe full Iceman studio album must be released in order to resolve this market. Further singles or Iceman video episodes will not be sufficient to resolve this market. Any Drake album officially confirmed to be the Iceman project will count, regardless of potential name changes.\n\nThe resolution source for the album release will be any official streaming or download site, e.g. Apple Music or Spotify. A consensus of credible reporting that a released album is the Iceman project may be used if Drake releases the album under a different name.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-07-31T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-07-31","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"closed":false,"commentCount":741,"competitive":0.9997750506136119,"createdAt":"2025-05-02T14:55:28.249386Z","creationDate":"2025-05-02T15:48:25.262669Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on predicting events that will occur before the release of Grand Theft Auto VI.","enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-07-31T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-happen-before-gta-vi-7hpNkEzQEqUE.jpg","id":"23784","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-happen-before-gta-vi-7hpNkEzQEqUE.jpg","liquidity":930676.50823,"liquidityClob":930676.50823,"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-happen-before-gta-vi","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2025-05-02T15:48:25.262673Z","ticker":"what-will-happen-before-gta-vi","title":"What will happen before GTA VI?","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T06:55:49.84631Z","volume":17330900.173083,"volume1mo":3038349.804863057,"volume1wk":380187.29243299674,"volume1yr":17327068.514425527,"volume24hr":11619.250150999998}],"featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"8","groupItemTitle":"Drake releases Iceman","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-happen-before-gta-vi-7hpNkEzQEqUE.jpg","id":"1117522","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-happen-before-gta-vi-7hpNkEzQEqUE.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.869,"liquidity":"25391.25073","liquidityClob":25391.25073,"liquidityNum":25391.25073,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.0035,"oneHourPriceChange":0.0065,"oneMonthPriceChange":-0.014,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.0705,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.876\", \"0.124\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Drake release Iceman before GTA VI?","questionID":"0xa1c2c3e248f048170f13cfd40bbf64d1d62b01416239fbd00840f60a0fe6bda2","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":4.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-drake-release-iceman-before-gta-vi","spread":0.01,"startDate":"2026-01-06T00:20:15.433097Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-06","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T06:55:22.095564Z","volume":"51520.58438","volume1mo":36467.06416200001,"volume1moClob":36467.06416200001,"volume1wk":5580.663013000002,"volume1wkClob":5580.663013000002,"volume1yr":51145.21438000003,"volume1yrClob":51145.21438000003,"volume24hr":762.420018,"volume24hrClob":762.420018,"volumeClob":51520.58438,"volumeNum":51520.58438}
