Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe percentage change in price for Bitcoin will be calculated by comparing the \"Close\" price for the Binance 1 minute candle for BTC/USDT on the last day of the specified month in the ET timezone to the \"Close\" price for the Binance 1 minute candle for BTC/USDT on the first day of the specified month, 12:00 AM in the ET timezone (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT).\n\nThe percentage change in NVIDIA (NVDA) will be calculated by comparing the official NVIDIA (NVDA) Close price for the last trading day of the specified month to the official NVIDIA (NVDA) Close price for the last trading day before the specified month, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA/historical-prices).\n\nIf either of the relevant days has no official closing price (for example, due to a trading halt into the market close, system issue, delisting, or other disruption), the market will use the last valid on-exchange trade price of the regular session as the effective closing price.\n\nExactly equal performance of both assets will not suffice for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe resolution sources for this market are Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT \"Close\" prices currently available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT with \"1m\" and \"Candles\" selected on the top bar, and the Wall Street Journal, specifically the Close values published by the WSJ under \"Historical Prices\" (US: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks, EMEA: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks/emea, ASIA:
