Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe percentage change in price for Bitcoin will be calculated by comparing the \"Close\" price for the Binance 1 minute candle for BTC/USDT on the last day of the specified month in the ET timezone to the \"Close\" price for the Binance 1 minute candle for BTC/USDT on the first day of the specified month, 12:00 AM in the ET timezone (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT).\n\nThe percentage change in Silver will be calculated by comparing the official Silver Continuous Contract (SI00) Close price for the last trading day of the specified month to the official Silver Continuous Contract (SI00) Close price for the last trading day before the specified month, as reported by MarketWatch (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/si00).\n\nExactly equal performance of both assets will not suffice for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe resolution sources for this market are Binance,
