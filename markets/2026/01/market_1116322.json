Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe percentage change in price for Bitcoin will be calculated by comparing the \"Close\" price for the Binance 1 minute candle for BTC/USDT on the last day of the specified month in the ET timezone to the \"Close\" price for the Binance 1 minute candle for BTC/USDT on the first day of the specified month, 12:00 AM in the ET timezone (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT).\n\nThe percentage change in the S&P 500 (SPX) will be calculated by comparing the official S&P 500 (SPX) Close price for the last trading day of the specified month to the official S&P 500 (SPX) Close price for the last trading day before the specified month, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/SPX/historical-prices).\n\nIf either of the relevant days has no official closing price (for example, due to a trading halt into the market close, system issue, delisting, or other disruption), the market will use the last valid on-exchange trade price of the regular session as the effective closing price.\n\nExactly equal performance of both assets will not suffice for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe resolution sources for this market are Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT \"Close\" prices currently available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT with \"1m\" and \"Candles\" selected on the top bar, and the Wall Street Journal, specifically the Close values published by the WSJ under \"Historical Prices\" (US: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks, EMEA: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks/emea, ASIA:
