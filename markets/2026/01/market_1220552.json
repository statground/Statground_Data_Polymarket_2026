The first stage of this test flight involves the firing of massive solid rocket boosters, which subsequently jettison and fall away from the rocket. Only after the boosters fall away will the Space Launch System (SLS) jettison the Launch Abort System and protective fairings designed to preserve the safety of the crew. This market is explicitly about the specified solid state boosters. You can read more about the Artemis II mission here: https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the booster for the Artemis II mission explodes at any point during the test from the start of fueling operations to 60 minutes after it makes contact with Earth upon landing. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nAn explosion is defined as a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction of all or part of the booster, regardless of intent or context (e.g., a planned termination event would also count).\n\nIf the launch has not occurred by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: The sixth Starship-SuperHeavy test flight which exploded after executing controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico would qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official video provided by NASA (https://www.youtube.com/nasa), as well as secondary video feeds and/or written reports if necessary.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-31T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2026-03-31","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"closed":false,"commentCount":45,"competitive":0.9794079478954972,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T15:55:04.730504Z","creationDate":"2026-01-20T16:01:44.680428Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.","enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-31T00:00:00Z","estimateValue":false,"featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spacex-starship-flight-test-10-KJ2wEPdcMh5k.jpg","id":"174722","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spacex-starship-flight-test-10-KJ2wEPdcMh5k.jpg","liquidity":15742.92191,"liquidityClob":15742.92191,"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"nasa-artemis-ii","startDate":"2026-01-20T16:01:44.680436Z","startTime":"2026-02-08T01:45:00Z","ticker":"nasa-artemis-ii","title":"NASA Artemis II","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T12:33:28.133117Z","volume":400652.325628,"volume1mo":397715.44129899994,"volume1wk":106473.924479,"volume1yr":397715.44129899994,"volume24hr":8066.355036999999}],"featured":false,"feeType":null,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"Artemis II booster rupture?","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spacex-starship-flight-test-10-KJ2wEPdcMh5k.jpg","id":"1220552","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spacex-starship-flight-test-10-KJ2wEPdcMh5k.jpg","lastTradePrice":0.109,"liquidity":"2797.93712","liquidityClob":2797.93712,"liquidityNum":2797.93712,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.005,"oneWeekPriceChange":0.004,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0.0965\", \"0.9035\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Artemis II booster rupture?","questionID":"0x0733d68e9620bf5e0a9e72027e9e13ffc1f13a40ca99efc16c4e25f4cd83b5a5","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x65070BE91477460D8A7AeEb94ef92fe056C2f2A7","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"artemis-ii-booster-rupture","spread":0.027,"startDate":"2026-01-20T16:01:02.102Z","startDateIso":"2026-01-20","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2026-02-16T12:36:31.89597Z","volume":"81347.87442","volume1mo":81334.404899,"volume1moClob":81334.404899,"volume1wk":2972.2823169999997,"volume1wkClob":2972.2823169999997,"volume1yr":81334.404899,"volume1yrClob":81334.404899,"volume24hr":395.75339399999996,"volume24hrClob":395.75339399999996,"volumeClob":81347.87442,"volumeNum":81347.87442}
