The closing share price on the first trading day will be determined from the primary exchange’s official listing page.\n\nIf the relevant value falls exactly between two brackets, this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official company filings and the primary exchange’s official listing page. The market capitalization will be determined through appropriate calculation using the total outstanding shares and the closing price from the first day of trading. \n\nIn the event of an interruption in the normal trading session on the specified company’s first day of trading (e.g., a circuit breaker or half-day), the market will resolve according to the official closing price of the abbreviated session. If no such official closing price is published, the market will resolve according to the next trading day on which an official closing price is published, treating that day as the first day of trading for the purposes of this market.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-20T00:00:00Z","estimateValue":true,"featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rank-one-computing-ipo-closing-market-cap-GwvDPdetLLi2.jpg","id":"219345","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rank-one-computing-ipo-closing-market-cap-GwvDPdetLLi2.jpg","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x67f3a011b3198c48377f05e672937624c74aec7adb30b1b8ce78ff68b3a8ff00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"seriesSlug":"ipo-closing-market-cap","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"rank-one-computing-ipo-closing-market-cap","startDate":"2026-02-20T16:39:11.607436Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:20:37.488Z","forceShow":false,"id":"107","label":"Business","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:20:37.48+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"business","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:11:02.874409Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:08:54.140507Z","forceShow":false,"id":"103152","isCarousel":false,"label":"Rewards 500, 4.5, 50","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"rewards-500-4pt5-50","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:03:11.679187Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:40.097768Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-21T23:06:12.324Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1401","label":"Tech","publishedAt":"2024-02-21 23:06:12.305+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"tech","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:17:30.722289Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-09-17T00:03:12.42045Z","id":"102599","label":"IPO","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ipo","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:24:11.130376Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-30T16:53:29.141Z","forceShow":false,"id":"600","label":"IPOs","publishedAt":"2023-11-30 16:53:29.136+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"ipos","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:09:32.705813Z"}],"ticker":"rank-one-computing-ipo-closing-market-cap","title":"Rank One Computing IPO Closing Market Cap","updatedAt":"2026-02-22T06:38:13.389475Z","volume":29908.465913,"volume1mo":29908.465913,"volume1wk":29908.465913,"volume1yr":29908.465913,"volume24hr":8907.313443}],"icon":"","id":"11134","image":"","liquidity":14906.23283,"recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"ipo-closing-market-cap","ticker":"ipo-closing-market-cap","title":"IPO Closing Market Cap","updatedAt":"2026-02-22T06:38:17.269882Z","volume":78903.479719,"volume24hr":11182.343589}
