Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No.”\n\nFor purposes of this market, internet access will be considered restored only if either of the following conditions is satisfied.\n\n1. Internet access will be considered restored if there is a clear, broad, and unambiguous consensus of credible international reporting stating that general internet connectivity has been restored for a majority of people in Iran and across most common applications, and that such connectivity has been sustained for at least 24 consecutive hours. Reporting describing planned restorations, gradual easing, partial reconnection, access limited to specific regions, networks, user groups, or applications, or access restricted to filtered, throttled, or government-controlled networks will not qualify. The reporting must explicitly indicate that normal international internet access has materially resumed.\n\n2. Alternatively, internet access will be considered restored only if both of the following requirements are met.\n\n- According to Cloudflare Radar data for Iran, total bytes transferred must recover to at least 50% of the prior four-weeks maximum for six consecutive hourly data points, as shown in the Traffic trends → Bytes transferred (Total bytes) chart. Only the first of the six consecutive qualifying hourly data points must occur before the market’s resolution time. If necessary to confirm the full sequence, the market will remain open until all qualifying data points are observed.\n\n- In addition, NetBlocks must report that the Iranian national internet outage has been resolved, or must publish a clearly equivalent statement indicating that internet access has been restored for the majority of people and across applications. Reports describing only limited, partial, or localized connectivity; connectivity restricted to filtered or government-controlled networks; traffic increases that NetBlocks characterizes as attempts to generate a false or misleading narrative of restored connectivity, or similar reports, will not qualify, even if the Cloudflare threshold is met.\n\nThe primary resolution sources for this market will be Cloudflare Radar (https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ir) data for Iran and public reporting from NetBlocks (https://netblocks.org/); however, a consensus of credible international reporting meeting the standards described above may also be used.","enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-30T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/internet-access-restored-in-iran-by-friday-ou8umVL77U88.jpg","id":"184351","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/internet-access-restored-in-iran-by-friday-ou8umVL77U88.jpg","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"seriesSlug":"internet-access-restored-in-iran","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"internet-access-restored-in-iran-by-friday-263","startDate":"2026-01-24T00:45:24.757665Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2025-03-19T23:36:08.498099Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101970","label":"World","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"world","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:25:05.462266Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:26:20.601Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"154","label":"Middle East","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:26:20.585+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"middle-east","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:03:26.068462Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:16:51.667Z","forceShow":false,"id":"78","label":"Iran","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:16:51.647+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"iran","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:01:45.286929Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:51.838963Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"internet-access-restored-in-iran-by-friday-263","title":"Internet access restored in Iran by Friday?","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T03:40:16.113339Z","volume":235206.107034,"volume1mo":220640.80703400006,"volume1wk":220640.80703400006,"volume1yr":220640.80703400006,"volume24hr":15616.260132000003}],"icon":"","id":"10913","image":"","recurrence":"weekly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"internet-access-restored-in-iran","ticker":"internet-access-restored-in-iran","title":"Internet access restored in Iran","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T06:30:28.242304Z"}
