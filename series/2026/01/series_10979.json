The monthly unemployment rate reported in the Labour Force Survey is published each month in the table titled “Labour Force participation rate, employment rate and unemployment rate” at https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en/dbview?sid=0003005865. The relevant figure may be found with ‘Rate [%]’, ‘All industries’, ‘Unemployed person’, and ‘All Japan’ selected, in the column for Both sexes and the row for the relevant month.\n\nThe next data release is scheduled for January 30, 2026. This market will resolve as soon as the relevant data is issued. Any revisions to the data after the first release will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nIf no data for the specified month is released by the date the next month's data is scheduled to be released, this market will resolve based on data from the last available month.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market reports unemployment to one decimal point. Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-01-30T00:00:00Z","estimateValue":false,"featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/october-unemployment-rate-japan-JTPL1XICqUq6.jpg","id":"190552","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/october-unemployment-rate-japan-JTPL1XICqUq6.jpg","liquidity":6277.8873,"liquidityClob":6277.8873,"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x9ef4c493d23a50966e82fdfe6f28a8d1b5cb0f8d64f1a393abbf5ef0318cce00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"seriesSlug":"japan-unemployment","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"december-2025-unemployment-rate-japan","startDate":"2026-01-27T22:47:22.934994Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:12:07.062835Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-03-11T22:41:09.272Z","id":"1624","label":"unemployment","publishedAt":"2024-03-11 22:41:09.266+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"unemployment","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:29:50.373267Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-03-26T21:57:53.430333Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102000","label":"Macro Indicators","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"macro-indicators","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:31:47.339472Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-12-17T17:28:41.207418Z","id":"101522","label":"Japan","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"japan","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:12:42.616593Z"}],"ticker":"december-2025-unemployment-rate-japan","title":"December 2025 Unemployment Rate - Japan","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T06:27:34.271366Z","volume":99.99,"volume1mo":79.99,"volume1wk":79.99,"volume1yr":79.99,"volume24hr":79.99}],"icon":"","id":"10979","image":"","liquidity":6277.8873,"recurrence":"monthly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"japan-unemployment","ticker":"japan-unemployment","title":"Japan Unemployment","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T06:27:40.613374Z","volume":99.99}
