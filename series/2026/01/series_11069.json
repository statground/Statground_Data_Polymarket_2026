The Street consensus estimate for Anheuser-Busch’s non-GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $0.89 as of market creation. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Anheuser-Busch reports non-GAAP EPS greater than $0.89 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents. \n\nIf Anheuser-Busch releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents; or, if not published there, according to the GAAP EPS provided by SeekingAlpha.
