Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor CME Copper (HG) futures contracts, the Active Month is the nearest of CME’s designated delivery-cycle months (March, May, July, September, and December) that is not the spot month. The Active Month becomes a non-active month effective on its First Position Date, at which point the next eligible contract month becomes the Active Month.\n\nOnly the Active Month's official settlement price published by CME Group will be considered. Intraday trades, highs, lows, bids, offers, midpoint values, or indicative prices do not count.\n\nNote that the settlement price may differ from the last traded price. CME's methodology to determine the settlement price can vary by commodity and contract.\n\nOnly the final trading day of the specified month, on which CME publishes an official settlement price for the Active Month, will be considered. Days without settlement prices (weekends, holidays, or market closures) are ignored.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the settlement price as it appears on the CME settlement page at the time it is first published for that trading day, regardless of any later corrections or updates.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the CME Group website — specifically, the daily \"Settlement\" price for the Active Month of Copper (HG) futures.","enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-28T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-copper-hg-hit-by-end-of-february-5NOd8uT0BVe4.png","id":"190583","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-copper-hg-hit-by-end-of-february-5NOd8uT0BVe4.png","liquidity":6466.30892,"liquidityClob":6466.30892,"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"seriesSlug":"copper-hg-above","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"copper-hg-above-end-of-february","startDate":"2026-01-27T18:45:52.5126Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-10-22T15:45:27.386784Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101031","label":"Commodities","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"commodities","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:09:32.712099Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T18:13:01.242396Z","id":"103282","label":"COMEX Copper Futures","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"comex-copper-futures","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:19.88051Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-05-23T18:47:07.430147Z","forceShow":false,"id":"102169","isCarousel":false,"label":"Hide From New","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"hide-from-new","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:15:10.460422Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T20:12:40.097768Z"}],"ticker":"copper-hg-above-end-of-february","title":"Copper (HG) above ___ end of February?","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T01:30:08.957202Z","volume":2605.670075,"volume1mo":2605.670075,"volume1wk":784.411201,"volume1yr":2605.670075}],"icon":"","id":"10981","image":"","liquidity":6466.30892,"recurrence":"monthly","requiresTranslation":false,"seriesType":"single","slug":"copper-hg-above","ticker":"copper-hg-above","title":"Copper (HG) above","updatedAt":"2026-02-10T01:30:18.279702Z","volume":2605.670075}
