Each AFRICOM press release describing a strike or series of strikes will count as one incident, unless AFRICOM explicitly distinguishes incidents as separate strike events. For example, the strikes on January 25-26, 2026 (https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/36183/us-forces-conduct-strikes-targeting-al-shabaab) and January 12, 2026 (https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/36174/us-forces-conduct-strikes-targeting-al-shabaab) would have counted as single incidents, even though they included multiple individual strikes.\n\nThe date of a qualifying strike incident will be determined by the date provided by AFRICOM. Any strike incident announced by AFRICOM to have occurred at least partially in the listed period will count (e.g. a strike incident announced to have occurred from January 31-February 1, 2026, would count). If the date of an announced strike is not released by AFRICOM, a consensus of credible reporting may be used to determine the timing of a strike incident. In this case, a strike will be considered to have occurred in the specified period if it is determined that it occurred in that period, in Eastern Time (timeframes partially, but not fully, in this period will count). Any strike incident announced by AFRICOM after February 1, 2026, 11:59 PM ET will not count, regardless of the timing of the strike.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) (https://www.africom.mil/media-gallery/press-releases); however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used to determine the timing of an announced strike incident.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-02-01T00:00:00Z","estimateValue":false,"featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-by-january-31-ZfjWT7qXorC3.jpg","id":"190600","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-by-january-31-ZfjWT7qXorC3.jpg","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"seriesSlug":"us-strike-on-somalia","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-jan-28-31","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:51.838963Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T19:00:55.849904Z","id":"103284","label":"AFRICOM","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"africom","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T19:05:02.907605Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-jan-28-31","title":"How many times will the US strike Somalia Jan 28-31?","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T20:20:04.250963Z","volume":0,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0},{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2026-02-03T21:17:24Z","commentCount":0,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:23:02.566703Z","creationDate":"2026-01-30T16:24:03.3334Z","cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if a US-initiated drone, missile, or air strike on the soil of Somalia is announced or credibly reported to have occurred between market creation and the listed date ET.

Each AFRICOM press release describing a strike or series of strikes will count as one incident, unless AFRICOM explicitly distinguishes incidents as separate strike events. For example, the strikes on January 25-26, 2026 (https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/36183/us-forces-conduct-strikes-targeting-al-shabaab) and January 12, 2026 (https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/36174/us-forces-conduct-strikes-targeting-al-shabaab) would have counted as single incidents, even though they included multiple individual strikes.\n\nThe date of a qualifying strike incident will be determined by the date provided by AFRICOM. Any strike incident announced by AFRICOM to have occurred at least partially in the listed period will count (e.g. a strike incident announced to have occurred from January 31-February 1, 2026, would count). If the date of an announced strike is not released by AFRICOM, a consensus of credible reporting may be used to determine the timing of a strike incident. In this case, a strike will be considered to have occurred in the specified period if it is determined that it occurred in that period, in Eastern Time (timeframes partially, but not fully, in this period will count). Any strike incident announced by AFRICOM after March 4, 2026, 11:59 PM ET will not count, regardless of the timing of the strike.\n\nThis market will remain open until March 4, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. If the date/time of a qualifying strike cannot be confirmed by that time, it will not count, regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) (https://www.africom.mil/media-gallery/press-releases); however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used to determine the timing of an announced strike incident.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2026-03-04T00:00:00Z","estimateValue":false,"featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-by-january-31-ZfjWT7qXorC3.jpg","id":"190746","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-by-january-31-ZfjWT7qXorC3.jpg","liquidity":69169.90245,"liquidityClob":69169.90245,"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xbb99e04e49474914eaf2e0fb7cb51e94a1910546813a272e2a84095bc8a97500","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"seriesSlug":"us-strike-on-somalia","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-in-february","startDate":"2026-01-28T00:25:01.842313Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:36:02.827402Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:10:34.896001Z","updatedBy":15},{"createdAt":"2026-01-27T19:00:55.849904Z","id":"103284","label":"AFRICOM","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"africom","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T19:05:02.907605Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-06-12T20:13:03.615956Z","forceShow":true,"id":"100265","label":"Geopolitics","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"geopolitics","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:51.838963Z"},{"createdAt":"2026-01-05T22:14:31.922993Z","id":"103063","label":"somalia","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"somalia","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T21:13:45.828392Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-times-will-the-us-strike-somalia-in-february","title":"How many times will the US strike Somalia in February?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T06:43:39.651824Z","volume":111024.225713,"volume1mo":110512.22331399999,"volume1wk":72755.581429,"volume1yr":110512.22331399999,"volume24hr":7434.1876219999995},{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"closed":false,"commentCount":0,"competitive":0.9455370650529501,"createdAt":"2026-02-03T23:09:15.384886Z","creationDate":"2026-02-03T23:27:26.33072Z","cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if a US-initiated drone, missile, or air strike on the soil of Somalia is announced or credibly reported to have occurred between market creation and the listed date ET.
